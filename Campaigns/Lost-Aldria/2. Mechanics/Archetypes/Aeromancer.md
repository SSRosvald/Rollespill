## Overview
The wizard most classically associated with with the [[Djinn]] of [[Cori-Land]], Aeromancers can manipulate powerful conflagrations against their foes. Despite its roots in battle however, these mages are often far more complex than many expect—much like how a howling wind can destroy, it can also give the warmth of the southern winds that the people of [[Cori-Land]] is so dependant.

## Class Features
# 1st level
## Manipulating the air
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to manipulate the elements of nature into the winds of the earth. Whenever you cast a spell that is included in the Arcane, Nature, and an element of nature, you can choose to make that nature type air, storm or weather.

## Cleansing Wind
When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to use the wind to not just harm but heal. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals wind, storm or weather damage, you can choose one creature that would take damage from the spell. Instead of taking damage from the spell, it is healed for a number of hit points equal to the spell’s level plus your proficiency bonus.

## Rituals of Wind
Also at 2nd level, you can feel the changes of the wind to learn of what lies ahead. By spending 10 minutes meditating while feeling the breeze on your body, you can cast _[augury](https://a5e.tools/spell/augury "Click to view a local node.")_ without spending any spell slots.

At 6th level, by levitating an object with a connection to a creature and spending 10 minutes in meditation, you can cast _[locate creature](https://a5e.tools/spell/locate-creature "Click to view a local node.")_ in this way. 

# 6th Level
## Clinging Wind
At 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals wind, storm or weather damage and forces a [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") , creatures that fail their first saving throw against it suffer ongoing nature damage equal to half your Intelligence modifier, and their movement is reduced by half. Attacks against these creatures grants an expertise die. At the start of each of its turns a creature repeats the saving throw, ending the ongoing damage on a success.

## The Winds of Change
At 6th level, you are able to cast an air, storm or weather spell by expending a spellslot one level lower than what the spell requires. This does not change how many spells you are able to prepare, but this allow you to expend one lvl 2 spell slot, and cast a lvl 3 spell of the mentioned type, or use a lvl 3 spell slot to upcast a lvl 3 spell to level 4 without using a lvl 4 spell slot.

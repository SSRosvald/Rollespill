# `=this.file.name`
	Behind the castle walls soldiers duck as acid falls upon them in a downpour. Many are heavily scalded, and are removed, screaming in pain as their comrades are dragged from the parapets. Heavy choking smoke spews from the burning castle tower, every breath taken filling lungs with hot air. The assaulting general, fully armored and bearing a blue standard, weaves amidst the fray on horse- back. As he charges past an enemy knight he nicks his foe’s mount on the knee with a spear, sending his enemy tumbling, and with a single command the loyal foot soldiers nearby quickly surround and subdue his target. 
	A group of mounted reinforcements hastily approach a battle under the cover of nearby forests — suddenly stopped by a hail of bolts that erupt from the shadows of the surrounding brush, whittling them down to nothing. Once the last of the cavalry are silenced the gnome marshal in charge of the ambush emerges, nodding, satisfied at the work of her soldiers. 
	As the dread of defeat looms over the defenders of a fortress a sharp whistle cuts through the air. Their half-orc leader gathers her underlings, telling them that she is aware that everyone is tired, that everyone wants this to end — and that the siege will end, but it will be on their terms. There may be wounded, but they are all still standing. The castle may have been under attack for weeks, but it too is still standing. As it will stand all the way through winter. Until then, their foes will see what it means to be proud defenders of one’s nation.
## Overview
Inspirational, cunning, and resourceful, tales of the most famed or notorious marshals often spread far and wide through heroic stories or whispers in the shadows about groups beating impossible odds to accomplish a goal, or outlasting opponents with an unusual trick up the sleeve. Some marshals may come from humble beginnings, while others are born destined to be leaders even if they did not have the intention to take up leadership. Despite the term, many adventurers who have never seen a single battlefield in their life often hold similar skills as that of a marshal. These individuals can range from a leader of a merchant caravan to a volunteer townwatch organizer who oversees a village’s wellbeing.
# The Power of Command 
The marshal’s greatest power comes from their ability to support those in action to be the best they can. They can point out a weakness, notice an unparalleled opportunity to exploit, or provide moral support for their allies, giving the perfect cutting edge in any situation. This occurs outside of combat too. A marshal can easily organize an effective search party or help navigate bureaucratic red tape with a few tips on how to work with a bureaucrat’s disposition — after all, the philosophy behind warfare is often just as applicable during careful negotiations. 
# A Motivated Adventurer 
Even though many of their talents shine through the performance of others, marshals themselves are often skilled combatants who know how to handle themselves in a fight, meaning they are well- equipped to become independent adventurers. While it certainly might seem unusual when many nations or organizations would pay handsomely for their services, marshals often take up adventuring for a variety of reasons. Some desire the freedom it has in comparison to the stuffy world of politics. Others may have taken up adventuring to seek the thrill of the unknown. Occasionally, a disgraced marshal may be looking to repair their reputation with some adventuring success — or so they would claim if asked over a drink at the tavern. One thing is for certain: if a marshal has taken up adventuring there is usually a good reason why they have chosen this path over others. 
# Creating a Marshal 
Consider the following questions when creating your marshal: what were their beginnings? How did they accumulate knowledge of the art of warfare? Through what events did they refine their skills? Do they value brawn, acumen, or both? Do they lead from the front lines, amidst their compatriots, or from a safe distance? How do they treat those they work with, those they work for, and those who work for them? What sort of emotion, or lack thereof, do they associate with the rush of battle, or the tension of negotiations? What is it about adventure that drew them away from other opportunities?

# 1st Level
## Commanding Presence

Starting at 1st level, you have a Commanding Presence which extends from you in a 10-foot radius. 

Your allies can attack at your command. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo making one attack to allow a friendly creature within range of your Commanding Presence to make an attack instead. If the target can hear or see you, it can use its reaction to either cast a cantrip or make one weapon attack.

The range of your presence increases to 20 feet at 5th level, 30 feet at 10th level, 45 feet at 15th level, and 60 feet at 20th level.
## Rallying Surge

Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to choose an ally within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear or see you, it regains hit points equal to 1d8 + your marshal level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") before you can use it again.

You can simultaneously target 2 allies with this feature at 3rd level, and starting at 7th level you regain use of this feature after finishing a short or long rest.

# 2nd Level
## Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: [Biting Zephyr](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=273&combine=), [Mirror’s Glint](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=274&combine=), [Mist and Shade](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=275&combine=), [Rapid Current](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=276&combine=), [Razor’s Edge](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=277&combine=), [Sanguine Knot](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=278&combine=), [Spirited Steed](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=279&combine=), [Unending Wheel](https://a5e.tools/combat-maneuvers?field_cm_tradition_target_id%5B0%5D=282&combine=). You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") . You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Marshal table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.
## Lessons of War

Also at 2nd level you learn a lesson of war of your choice. Your lessons are detailed at the end of the class description. The Lessons Known column of the Marshal table shows when you learn more lessons of war.
# 3rd Level
## Marshal Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that focuses on the military stratagems you devise. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.
## Mark Foe

Also at 3rd level, your martial direction improves the efficiency of your allies’ attacks against an enemy you focus their attention on. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the start of your next turn, creatures able to hear or see you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on attacks made against that creature.
# 4th Level
## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
# 5th Level
## Combat Directives

Starting at 5th level, you can direct your companions so effectively that they can use the techniques you’ve mastered. You learn one additional combat maneuver from the Sanguine Knot tradition. This combat maneuver does not count against the number of combat maneuvers that you know.

In addition, when a creature uses your Commanding Presence to make an attack, it can simultaneously use one Sanguine Knot combat maneuver that you know. If the creature does not have any exertion points to spend on combat maneuvers, it does not require exertion points for that use but it cannot benefit from Combat Directives again until it has finished a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level.
## Followers

At 5th level, you gain one inexperienced [follower](https://a5e.tools/rules/followers "Click to view a local node.") . At 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you gain an additional follower or one of your followers becomes more experienced.

When one of your followers dies, after 1 month you receive word that their replacement is ready to join you.
# 6th Level 
## Call to Arms

Beginning at 6th level, when you roll initiative, you and each creature friendly to you that are within range of your Commanding Presence gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") to their initiative check. Additionally, when you roll for initiative, you can switch your result with that of any ally you can see.
## Martial Renown

At 6th level, tales of your deeds take root in the hearts of the people. As a leader, you are more famous than most adventurers. You add half your proficiency bonus to your Prestige rating.

In addition, your reputation strongly affects how you are perceived, and when it becomes known that you are in a settlement people treat you accordingly. At the Narrator’s discretion, there may be settlements (such as an enemy’s war camp) where you cannot utilize this feature. Choose one of the following:

### Famous

When you arrive in a settlement, after you reveal who you are local authority figures seek you out to make introductions and invite you to share a meal or drink. 

In addition, you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Persuasion checks. 

### Infamous

When you arrive in a settlement, after you reveal who you are common folk hurry to get out of your way, and when you corner a commoner to ask about something local they rapidly tell you whatever details they think you might want to know. 

In addition, you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Intimidation checks.

### Maverick

When you arrive in a settlement, after you reveal who you are the local watch starts keeping an eye on you. Heads of illegal organizations may introduce themselves to you if they have goals well suited to your talents. Additionally, guards expect you’re up to no good so are quick to leave their posts to follow you.
## Versatile Exploration

Also at 6th level, whenever you learn a new lesson of war or replace an existing one, you can instead choose from fighter soldiering knacks.
# 7th Level
Archetype Feature

At 7th level you gain another archetype feature.

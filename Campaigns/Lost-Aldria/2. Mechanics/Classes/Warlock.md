# Warlock

![Warlock](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/walock.png)

Warlocks meddle with forbidden powers, forces which wiser (or less courageous) folk would leave well enough alone. When fairy tales, ghost stories, and religious narratives strike fear into the masses, you instead sense an opportunity for growth.  
  
Following the breadcrumbs to the front door of destiny, you knocked and were forever changed by the power you found on the other side. The bond forged between the seeker and their supernatural patron is called a pact—which can have any number of terms and stipulations, most commonly arcane power in return for work-in-kind. Some pacts are more like curses and afflictions, making unwitting victims of the generations to come. 

## Arcane Patronage

Every warlock gains their magic from a powerful being, typically an otherworldly or supernatural entity. 

The arrangement and relationship between warlock and patron can vary greatly. Many warlocks love power for its own sake and will break any taboo in exchange for arcane supremacy. Some warlocks are, in effect, revivalists of elder magical and religious traditions which have fallen to the wayside or become maligned in the present era (often for good reason). Other warlocks still are mere hapless nobodies entangled in magical arrangements beyond their ken.

Warlock patrons are equally diverse. To speak of a warlock patron conventionally pins the patron as a powerful demon lord, eladrin monarch, or alien intelligence. Although this is often true, the power of such beings often trickles along innumerable tendrils of influence, including powerful envoys, mentor warlocks, intergenerational curses or blessings, relics and rites, corpses of long-dead gods, and extraplanar life forms who find home in the human body. Each vector is enough for the patron to whisper to the warlock the sordid secrets of the multiverse.

## Wedged Between Worlds

There is only a small bubble in the multiverse where mortals can safely inhabit, which means any seeker can find a path to eldritch power if they are willing to uncover that which rational society would keep hidden. As a would-be warlock tears at the seams and stitches of sanity (or unwittingly falls through the gaps), there are social and ontological prices to pay. They come to question the state of their soul, mind, and physiology—all of which are subject to contamination by extraplanar forces.

Warlocks are lords over the edges of society, safety, and sanity. They take their name from an ancient word meaning “oathbreaker,” because their arts appear to blaspheme against their own lives. Shunned from polite company, warlock collectives are rare and frequently unstable so to find genuine community they must become more than mere mortals—which is precisely the warlock ethos.

## Creating a Warlock

Whether you be an unassuming villager, a cunning scoundrel, a seeker of arcane power, or a victim of supernatural circumstance—you have a pact forged with an otherworldly patron, the terms of which set the tone for your entire adventure. 

What circumstances drew you into an eldritch pact? The allure of power? Love, fear, and sheer happenstance? Did forming your pact involve anybody else, like someone you know or love? Does your pact have noteworthy conditions and consequences, or is that all a secret? Does your pact leave any outward mark on your person—such as a tattoo or scar—or are the signs of your pact more ephemeral? 

Is your patron close at hand or chillingly distant? How did you select your patron? Or is it that your patron chose you? How do you maintain contact with your patron? Or is it that you think you can run away?

## ![1st Level](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/1%20copy%202-modified_1.png)Warlock Archetype

At 1st level, you have reached out to, stumbled upon, or otherwise crossed paths with a powerful entity beyond the ken of mortals, an otherworldly patron who sets you on the path of a Warlock Archetype. Whether you were willing, coerced, tricked—or if you exploited elder magical laws—a bargain was struck and you gained great power in exchange. Your choice of archetype grants you an expanded spell list and features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Expanded Spell List

When you choose an archetype, you also choose an expanded spell list your patron grants you access to. Choose one patron expanded spell list. These spells count as warlock spells for you. 

The enigmatic and often horrifying patrons of the Alienist convey the secrets of psionics and the stars. Some also teach about the darkness between stars. 

The patrons of the Diabolist—often portrayed as demons, devils, and the shadow of the inner self—often grant spells of darkness and fire. 

Faeries instruct their Spellbound on capricious spells related to bewilderment and mobility. The spiteful fey of the Unseelie Court also adore spells of darkness, and fairies who guard natural landforms might specialize in a given element like fire.

## ![1st Level](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/1%20copy%202_1.png)Pact Magic

With care, practice, and dedication you have learned how to best siphon and channel the otherworldly powers you’ve gained from your patron. 

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

### Spell Points

The Warlock table shows how many spell points you have. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of spell points dependent on the spell’s level, shown on the table below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by spending the appropriate number of spell points. The maximum spell level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Warlock table. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a short or long rest.

**Table: Spell Points**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Spell Level**|**Spell Points**|
|1st|2|
|2nd|3|
|3rd|5|
|4th|6|
|5th|7|

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st- or 2nd-level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level of which you can cast.

### Spellcasting Ability

The manner in which you pursue ever greater power from your patron is defined by the nature of that pursuit: through wit, devotion, or fervor. Choose Knowledge, Willpower, or Glamour to be your spellcasting ability. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use the chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

## ![1st Level](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/1%20copy%202_1.png)Eldritch Blast

At 1st level you learn to use your patron’s power as a weapon, blasting enemies with an eldritch force that defies even the laws of magic. Choose one of the following features:

### Eldritch Disturbance

You can use an action to strike a creature you can see within 60 feet with a reality-distorting curse, blending pain both mental and physical. The target makes a Wisdom [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") , taking 1d10 force damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

### Eldritch Ray

You can use an action to create a deadly beam that strikes a creature within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature, dealing 1d10 force damage pluss spell damage bonus on a hit.

### Eldritch Scythe

Once per turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee spell attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage pluss spell damage bonus. In addition, you can choose a different creature that you can see and that is within your reach. It takes half as much damage.

### Eldritch Whip

You can use an action to thrash a creature with a scintillating tendril of arcane force. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 force damage pluss spell damage bonus on a hit.

At the end of your turn you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum 1), which last until the end of your next turn. When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Whip and you already have temporary hit points, you can end the temporary hit points early to gain a bonus to the Eldritch Whip’s damage roll equal to half the number of temporary hit points you ended early.

---

## ![Level 2](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/2%20copy%202.png)Eldritch Invocations

The gifts of your patron are manyfold—not only can you channel their magic to work spells, but you can also siphon away talents, tricks, and reality-defying essence to perform other impressive magical feats.

At 2nd level, you gain an eldritch invocation of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. If you should gain a bonus invocation, they do not count against your Invocations known.

**Extra Secrets of Arcana.** When you are able to learn a new invocation in this way, you may instead choose to learn a secret of arcana.

---

## ![Level 2](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/2%20copy%202.png)Secrets of Arcana

Also at 2nd level, you realize that there is power to be taken that your patron may never have meant for you to have. You gain a secret of arcana of your choice. Your secrets are detailed at the end of the class description. The Secrets Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more secrets of arcana.

---

## ![Level 3](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/3%20copy%202.png)Pact Boon

At 3rd level, the entity to which you are beholden provides a more durable and lasting blessing. Choose one of the following features.

### Pact of the Blade 

You can use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any simple or martial weapon when you conjure your pact weapon. You are proficient with it while you wield your pact weapon, and you can use your spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. 

By performing a 1 hour ritual while holding a magic weapon or rare weapon, you can transform it into your pact weapon. If this weapon has a bonus to attack or damage rolls, or if it deals bonus damage, you can apply these to your Eldritch Blast (ranged weapons add these bonuses to Eldritch Ray, and melee weapons to Eldritch Scythe; it has no effect on Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Whip). You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon is collected by your patron if the bond breaks while it is in the extradimensional space. 

### Pact of the Chain 

You learn the _[find familiar](https://a5e.tools/spell/find-familiar "Click to view a local node.")_ spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [imp](https://a5e.tools/node/1518 "Click to view a local node.") , [pseudodragon](https://a5e.tools/node/1764 "Click to view a local node.") , [quasit](https://a5e.tools/node/1507 "Click to view a local node.") , [sprite](https://a5e.tools/node/1609 "Click to view a local node.") , or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the spirit you call forth to be an aberration, elemental, or undead.

When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Additionally, when you use Eldritch Scythe, you can choose to deliver the attack through your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range of touch.

### Pact of the Tome 

Aware of your drive for knowledge, you awaken to find a grimoire left in your pack by your patron: a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips. While the book is in your possession, you know these cantrips and they are treated as warlock spells. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony destroys the previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.

---

## ![Level 4](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/4%20copy%202.png)Invocation of the Courts

Also at 4th level, you gain a bonus invocation—one to help you traffic in courts both otherworldly and mortal. Choose one invocation from the following list: Beguiling Influence, Courts of the Outer Realms, Eyes of the Runekeeper, Gaze of Two Minds, Mask of Many Faces, Ominous Tormentor, Psionic Secrecy, Spellbinding Contract, Voice of the Chain Master, Whispers of the Grave. 

You gain another bonus invocation in this way at 10th level and again at 16th level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bonus invocations you know and replace it with another bonus invocation from this list that you could learn at that level.

---

## ![Level 5](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/5%20copy%202.png)Extra Blast

Beginning at 5th level, your Eldritch Blast becomes more vicious. When you use Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, or Eldritch Whip as part of your action on your turn, as long as you make no weapon attacks you can attack twice instead of once. At 11th level you can make three attacks, and at 17th level you can make four attacks. 

In addition, your Eldritch Disturbance’s damage increases by 1d10 at 5th level, and again at 11th level and 17th level (to a maximum of 4d10).

These improvements are based on your warlock level, not your character level. This feature otherwise counts as Extra Attack (for the purpose of qualifying for feats, spell effects, and the like).

## ![6th Level](https://a5e.tools/sites/default/files/inline-images/6%20copy%202_4.png)Eldritch Evolution

### Aura of Anathema

Hostile creatures within 120 feet gain [vulnerability](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") to necrotic damage. A creature with [resistance](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") to necrotic damage instead loses its resistance, and a creature [immune](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") to necrotic damage instead replaces that immunity with resistance.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose a different damage type for your aura.

### Highest Arcanum

You learn an ultimate exploit in the laws of magic. Choose one of the following:

- You can cast _[plane shift](https://a5e.tools/spell/plane-shift "Click to view a local node.")_ without material components once between [short rests](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

### Shade of Smoke

_Prerequisite: [Pact of the Censer](https://a5e.tools/rules/pact-censer "Click to view a local node.") feature_

As an action, you may cause your censer to billow a dense cloud of colorful smoke. This forms into a smoky shade of yourself in an adjacent square. This shade can’t create sound, light, scent (aside from a faint, smoky fragrance), or other sensory effects, though it can be the target of spells that create such effects. As a bonus action or as part of the bonus action to move your censor, you can mentally command this image of smoke to act however you wish (including interacting with a smoky version of any item in your possession when the shade was created), but it always remains centered on the censer.

The shade is revealed as smoke with any physical interaction, as physical objects and creatures pass through it, though it grants your censer total cover. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the shade is an illusion. The shade holds its form in light and moderate winds, but distorts in strong winds, revealing it to be an illusion. The shade only grants [half cover](https://a5e.tools/rules/world-bonuses-penalties-and-cover "Click to view a local node.") to your censer against attacks made by creatures that have seen it as an illusion. The shade remains for a 1 minute, until you dismiss it (no action required), or if leave your censer’s range.

Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your [spellcasting](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") ability modifier, you can’t do so again until you finish a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

### Smoke Cloud Conjurer

_Prerequisite: 7th level, [Pact of the Censer](https://a5e.tools/rules/pact-censer "Click to view a local node.") feature_

Your censer now has a number of charges equal to your [spellcasting](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") ability modifier and regains all spent charges after you take a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") . While your censer is summoned, you can expend 1 charge to cast _[fog cloud](https://a5e.tools/spell/fog-cloud "Click to view a local node.")_ without spending spell points. You can also expend 3 charges to cast _[stinking cloud](https://a5e.tools/spell/stinking-cloud "Click to view a local node.")_ without spending spell points.

You must be holding your censer to cast these spells, which visually appear to be smoke. You may expend an extra charge when you cast one of these spells through your censer to grant yourself the ability to see in these clouds as if the area were only [lightly obscured](https://a5e.tools/rules/environment "Click to view a local node.") or two charges to grant yourself and a number of creatures up to your [spellcasting](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") ability modifier within 30 feet the ability to see in these clouds as if the area were only lightly obscured.

When you cast one of the above spells using this feature you are not required to [concentrate](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") on the spell. However, the spell immediately ends if your censer leaves your hand or if you spend any additional charges.

You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. 

When you find a spell with the ritual tag, you can transcribe it into your Book of Shadows if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up). For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gold for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

This entity may also use such surfaces to bridge communication with you on its own terms.

You can also use this invocation to cast augury without spending spell points. Casting the spell in this way does not require material components, although you do need a reflective surface by which your patron might appear to you. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### One with Shadows

_Prerequisite: 5th level_

You can use an action to become [invisible](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") while you are in an area of dim light or darkness. Your invisibility lasts until you move, take an action, or use your reaction.

***Keen Smell***. The drop bear has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell. 
## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bear makes two melee attacks. 
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage. 
***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the bear canâ€™t attack a different target with its claws. 
## Description
Drop bears hide in trees and attack their prey by falling upon them from above. Numerous folk tales suggest outlandish methods to avoid these attacks, but the only proven tactic is simply not to pass beneath the trees where the bears make their homes.
## Additional Details
Drop bears have no swim Speed but gain a climb Speed of 40 feet and advantage on Stealth checks in forested areas. They take no damage from falling 40 feet or fewer, and deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage when they hit with an attack after falling at least 20 feet. A creature that takes this extra damage is knocked prone.

You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory, in much the same way you would for a location. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Considering these questions is useful for turning a generic magic item, such as a _+1 longsword_ or a suit of _+1 chain mail_, into a more remarkable discovery.

The tables that follow can help you come up with answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. Some of the table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. Some magic items are made only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a [cloak of elvenkind](https://5e.tools/items.html#cloak%20of%20elvenkind_dmg) is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up your own.

When letting the players find new items, let them roll a d20. On a 1-5, the item is not special, do not roll for special features. On a 6-15, the item is a little special, and the player rolls 1d4 to see which of the categories it is special in. On a 16-19, the item is rather special, and they roll 1d4 two times, and the item get both properties. On a 20 (critical), the item get all four categories

| 1     | **Aberration.** The item was created by aberrations in ancient times, possibly for the use of favored humanoid thralls. When seen from the corner of the eye, the item seems to be moving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2-4   | **Human.** The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten tongue or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5     | **Celestial.** The weapon is half the normal weight and inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and other symbols of good. Fiends find the item's presence repulsive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6     | **Dragon.** This item is made from scales and talons shed by a dragon. Perhaps it incorporates precious metals and gems from the dragon's hoard. It grows slightly warm when within 120 feet of a dragon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7     | **Drow.** The item is half the normal weight. It is black and inscribed with spiders and webs in honor of Lolth. It might function poorly, or disintegrate, if exposed to sunlight for 1 minute or more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8-9   | **Dwarf.** The item is durable and has Dwarven runes worked into its design. It might be associated with a clan that would like to see it returned to their ancestral halls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10    | **Elemental Air.** The item is half the normal weight and feels hollow. If it's made of fabric, it is diaphanous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11    | **Elemental Earth.** This item might be crafted from stone. Any cloth or leather elements are studded with finely polished rock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12    | **Elemental Fire.** This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Sigils of flames cover its surface. Shades of red and orange are the prominent colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13    | **Elemental Water.** Lustrous fish scales replace leather or cloth on this item, and metal portions are instead crafted from seashells and worked coral as hard as any metal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14-15 | **Elf.** The item is half the normal weight. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 16    | **Fey.** The item is exquisitely crafted from the finest materials and glows with a pale radiance in moonlight, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius Any metal in the item is silver or mithral, rather than iron or steel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 17    | **Fiend.** The item is made of black iron or horn inscribed with runes, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of fiends. It is warm to the touch and features leering faces or vile runes engraved on its surface. Celestials find the item's presence repulsive.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18    | **Giant.** The item is larger than normal and was crafted by giants for use by their smaller allies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 19    | **Gnome.** The item is crafted to appear ordinary and it might look worn. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these aren't essential to the item's function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20    | **Undead.** The item incorporates imagery of death such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21-22 | **Accidental.** This magic item was never deliberately enchanted, but acquired it by chance. Perhaps it sat for ages amidst other magics and absorbed their energy, or was used to strike a death blow against a fiend performing a potent ritual. It likely appears old and used, but is still in good condition.                                                                                                                                    |
| 23    | **Ancestral Bloodline.** Crafted for a particular family, this magic item gained its enchantment from multiple generations of their belief and veneration. It bears a family crest, though it may not be immediately obvious. Members of the bloodline want it returned when they learn of it, and others might assume the bearer is related to the original family.                                                                                  |
| 24-25 | **Aquatic.** Crafted by merfolk, tritons, or similar aquatic (but non-elemental) cultures, this magic item is made of coral, sea plants, and scales. Using it underwater does not impose disadvantage even if it normally would (such as attacking with certain weapons), nor does it count toward encumbrance for determining penalties to swimming.                                                                                                 |
| 26    | **Dawncraft.** This ancient magic item comes from the dawn of the most recent age, before humans, elves, and dwarves became—culturally, physically, even mentally—what they are today. It is crafted of bone, stone, or tanned animal pelt, and may be adorned with feathers, small bones, or other fetishes.                                                                                                                                         |
| 27    | **Divine Gift.** No mortal hands crafted this magic item. It was placed by the gods themselves, or agents thereof, for mortals to find—perhaps intended for a great hero on a legendary quest, or maybe simply to see what happens to it. The magic item is impossibly perfect in all respects, and it counts as a holy symbol.                                                                                                                       |
| 28    | **Futurecraft.** This item is from the future or a civilization far beyond the world on which it was found. Its magics might be activated by small buttons or switches, its lines are sleek, its metals and fabrics unidentifiable, and it may even consist of substances completely unknown to the campaign setting.                                                                                                                                 |
| 29    | **Incarnated Magic.** The magic item sprang forth whole, its physical and mystical properties already intact, from more powerful magic, such as a wish or a lucky draw from a deck of many things. It is remarkably plain, lacking any artistic flourish or individual touch.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30    | **Legendary Crafter.** Spoken of in history, legend, and song, a nigh-mythical smith or crafter created this magic item. So skilled was this artisan that their creations were innately magical, requiring no ritual or enchantment to gain their power. This magic item is expertly made and bears the legendary personal sigil of its creator.                                                                                                      |
| 31    | **Offering.** One culture made this magic item as a gift to another (perhaps to commemorate a treaty, as a sign of friendship, or under duress). Choose two appropriate origins from these tables, one as the giver and one as the receiver—the magic item has some traits of both.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 32-33 | **Osseus.** This magic item is made of bone with ragged edges and dangling strips of other materials but it is brutally functional. If a weapon, it grows warm whenever it delivers a critical hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34    | **Planar Battlefield.** The afterlives of several gods or pantheons are everlasting battlefields where souls are reborn every morning to fight again. This magic item (most appropriately a weapon, shield, or armor, but anything is justifiable with the right story) is a creation from one of those planes, intended to equip its eternal warriors. It bears the symbols of that plane or the gods ruling there.                                  |
| 35    | **Planar Echo.** This is a “copy” of a mundane item from the Material Plane is native to the Bleak Gate, the Dreaming, or another dimension that echoes the real world. Due to planar vagaries this copy is magical even though the original is not. Magic items native to the Bleak gate are dim, lighter than expected, and cold to the touch. Those native to the Dreaming resemble nature in strange ways and occasionally change shape or color. |
| 36    | **Servant of Chaos.** This magic item is made of strange, unidentifiable materials. Its design is uneven, imbalanced, with excessive parts or flourishes that serve no obvious purpose. Creatures with the Lawful alignment trait find its presence repulsive.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37    | **Servant of Order.** Minimalist and straightforward, symmetrical and technically perfect, this magic item strikes a precise balance between form and function. Creatures with the Chaotic alignment trait find its presence repulsive.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38    | **Shapeshifter.** This magic item appears to be an average example of its type. When wielded by a shapeshifter (such as a doppelganger) it changes appearance to match whatever guise the wielder assumes. The magic item’s basic nature is not affected, only the specifics of its appearance                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39    | **Titan.** Made either by the creations of the gods themselves for use by their servants, or by mortals who venerate them, this magic item bears icons of religious significance, forgotten history, and possibly of widespread destruction. It weighs 50% more than similar items. Whenever this magic item is used to deal damage to an inanimate object (either with a weapon attack or by casting a spell) it deals an extra 1d4 damage.          |
| 40    | **Vestige.** Created by the fading remnants of a forgotten god, or by one of its few surviving adherents, this item feels almost insubstantial. It weighs half as much as similar items and often seems on the verge of fading away entirely. When in the area of detect magic or similar effects, there is a 10% chance that it appears to be nonmagical.                                                                                            |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Arcane.** This item was created for an ancient order of spellcasters and bears the order's symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | **Bane.** This item was created by the foes of a particular culture or kind of creature. If the culture or creatures are still around, they might recognize the item and single out the bearer as an enemy.                                                                                                |
| 3   | **Heroic.** A great hero once wielded this item. Anyone who's familiar with the item's history expects great deeds from the new owner.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | **Ornament.** The item was created to honor a special occasion. Inset gemstones, gold or platinum inlays, and gold or silver filigree adorn its surface.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Prophecy.** The item features in a prophecy: its bearer is destined to play a key role in future events. Someone else who wants to play that role might try to steal the item, or someone who wants to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled might try to kill the item's bearer.                    |
| 6   | **Religious.** This item was used in religious ceremonies dedicated to a particular deity. It has holy symbols worked into it. The god's followers might try to persuade its owner to donate it to a temple, steal the item for themselves, or celebrate its use by a cleric or paladin of the same deity. |
| 7   | **Sinister.** This item is linked to a deed of great evil such as a massacre or an assassination. It might have a name or be closely associated with a villain who used it. Anyone familiar with the item's history is likely to treat it and its owner with suspicion.                                    |
| 8   | **Symbol of Power.** This item was once used as part of royal regalia or as a badge of high office. Its former owner or that person's descendants might desire it, or someone might mistakenly assume its new owner is the item's legitimate inheritor.                                                    |

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Artful.** While the magic item is on your person, you gain proficiency with one tool chosen by the Narrator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | **Beacon.** The bearer can use a bonus action to cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3   | **Beckoner.** When you are separated from the magic item you instinctively know its direction and roughly how far away it is. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours or until the magic item is attuned to someone else, whichever comes first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4   | **Brave.** When you contemplate or undertake a cowardly act—or choose to be modest when a more daring option is available—the magic item enhances feelings of shame and guilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5   | **Bulwark.** If the magic item is in your possession for the entire time, you gain 5 temporary hit points when you finish a long rest. These temporary hit points last up to 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6   | **Compass.** The wielder can use an action to learn which way is north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7   | **Conscientious.** When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the item enhances pangs of conscience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 8   | **Cowardly.** When you are presented with an opportunity to act in a cowardly or self-preserving manner, the magic item heightens your urge to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 9   | **Delver.** While underground, the bearer of this item always knows the item's depth below the surface and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 10  | **Devoted.** The magic item fights to remain attuned to you. It must be separated from you for twice as long (48 hours) to break the attunement. If a new creature attempts to attune the item when a prior attunement is still in effect, it makes a DC 14 Charisma check at the end of its short rest. On a failure, the item fails to attune to the creature, remaining attuned to you.                                                                                                                           |
| 11  | **Enigmatic.** Neither examination over the course of a short rest, nor identify or similar magics, reveal this magic item’s properties.

| 12  | **Fastidious.** You can use an action to magically clean yourself, your equipment, and the magic item of dirt, grime, sweat, and so on. Once you have used this property, you must finish a long rest before it can be used again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 15  | **Gloom-Sight.** If you have darkvision, the effective distance of that darkvision increases by 20 feet while you possess the magic item. It does not, however, grant darkvision to you if you do not have darkvision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 20  | **Illusion.** The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the item's appearance in minor ways. Such alterations don't change how the item is worn, carried, or wielded, and they have no effect on its other magical properties. For example, the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or make a gold ring look like it's made of ivory. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it.                                                                |

| 26  | **Schemer.** You can use an action and choose one creature you can hear and see. For the next min- ute or until you choose to end the effect (no action required), anything you say can only be heard by the chosen creature. Once you have used this property, you must finish a long rest before it can be used again.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 33  | **Temperate.** The bearer suffers no harm in temperatures as cold as -20 degrees Fahrenheit or as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 34  | **Unbreakable.** The item can't be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35  | **Unwavering.** The magic item grants you an extra sliver of luck to slightly mitigate unfavorable conditions. When the magic item is created, the Narrator chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws. When you have disadvantage on a roll of the chosen type, you gain an expertise die.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36  | **War Leader.** The bearer can use an action to cause his or her voice to carry clearly for up to 300 feet until the end of the bearer's next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37  | **Waterborne.** This item floats on water and other liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 38  | **Wicked.** When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer's urge to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 39  | **Dual-Featured.** Roll twice, rerolling any additional results of 20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| :-: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Aesthetic.** While in possession of this magic item you become exceptionally fascinated by sights of beauty—artwork, lush growth, scenic vistas—and feel the urge to take every opportunity to stop and appreciate them.                                                                                                                                                       |
|  2  | **Bearer’s Mark.** The magic item physically marks you for as long as it remains in your possession. This might take the form of a tattoo or brand, an unnatural change in eye or hair color, a slight alteration in the shape of a facial feature (such as your ears becoming pointed if the magic item is elven-made), and so on. This change is always minor, but noticeable. |
|  3  | **Blissful.** While in possession of the item, the bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item's presence.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  4  | **Bond.** The Narrator randomly selects one of your companions. While in possession of the magic item, you make every effort to perform little favors and services for, and to protect, that individual.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  5  | **Confident.** The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  6  | **Covetous.** The item's bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  7  | **Devout.** You must recite a prayer to one or more of the gods (of your choice) before a long rest or else you gain no benefit from that rest. You must have given up the magic item at least 24 hours prior before this requirement fades. In addition, so long as you have made the prayer in the last 24 hours you gain an expertise die on Religion checks.                 |
|  8  | **Dreamer.** The magic item causes unnatural dreams. You might dream in a different language, or in unidentifiable colors, or even using senses you don’t actually possess. This has no effect on the quality of the bearer’s rest.                                                                                                                                              |
|  9  | **Empathic.** This magic item changes appearance to match your mood. Sadness might cause it to appear worn and to turn blue, happiness might cause it to gleam brightly, anger might make it turn red and radiate heat, and so on. These alterations are purely cosmetic and do not alter the magic item’s function in any way.                                                  |
| 10  | **Frail.** The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11  | **Hungry.** This item's magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12  | **Leech.** The magic item feeds off healing magics cast on you. When you benefit from any spell or magical effect that causes you to regain hit points, you regain 1 fewer hit point than normal.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13  | **Loud.** The item makes a loud noise-such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong-when used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 14  | **Metamorphic.** The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item's use.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 15  | **Mirrored.** While the magic item is in your possession, whichever of your hands is usually dominant changes—if you are right-handed you become left-handed, and vice-versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16  | **Muttering.** The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully to the item might learn something useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17  | **Odorous.** The magic item emits a constant odor determined by the Narrator. This might be a pleasant floral scent, an animal musk, a miasma of rot, or the like. Depending on the scent, insects or small animals might be attracted to or repelled by the magic item.                                                                                                         |
| 18  | **Painful.** The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19  | **Possessive.** The item demands attunement when first wielded or worn, and it doesn't allow its bearer to attune to other items. (Other items already attuned to the bearer remain so until their attunement ends.)                                                                                                                                                             |
| 20  | **Prim.** The magic item imposes a harmless but intense flash of pain whenever you tell a lie, utter a profanity, fail to show proper respect to an important individual, or generally behave in a rude or indecorous manner.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21  | **Ravenous.** The magic item imposes a constant hunger. While the magic item is in your possession, you consume twice as much Supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22  | **Repulsive.** The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23  | **Restless.** The magic item desperately wants to be used. If you go 24 hours without using it, you suffer a level of strife that disappears the moment the magic item is used. For any item that is consumable or has limited charges that are not regained, reroll.                                                                                                            |
| 24  |  **Slothful.** The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Description
You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

#### Chainbreaker Strike
You have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon against creatures grappling an unwilling target. The first time each turn you hit such a creature, you deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to it, and the grappled creature can use its reaction to automatically escape the grapple.

#### Call Upon the Ancestors
As an action, you can call upon the ghostly forms of [[Rindeball]] and [[Druzhaan]] to reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (their choice) against your combat maneuver DC or be restrained. While restrained, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, ot is freed, and the spirits return to the afterlife. 

This can be used an amount of time equals to your proficiency bonus between long rests.

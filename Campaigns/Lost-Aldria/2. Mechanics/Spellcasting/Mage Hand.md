## Effects
A faintly shimmering phantasmal hand appears at a point you choose within range. It remains until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 30 feet from it.

You can use an action to control the hand and direct it to do any of the following:Â 

- manipulate an object.
- open an unlocked container or door.
- stow or retrieve items from unlocked containers.

The hand cannot attack, use magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

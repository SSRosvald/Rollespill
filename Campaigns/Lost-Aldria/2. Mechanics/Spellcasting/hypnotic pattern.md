You conjure a swirling pattern of twisting hues that roils through the air, appearing for a moment and then vanishing. Creatures in the area that can perceive the pattern make a Wisdom [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") or become [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]] . A creature charmed by this spell becomes [[conditions#incapacitated|incapacitated]] and its Speed is reduced to 0.

The effect ends on a creature when it takes damage or when another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.

You wreathe a creature in an illusory veil, making it [[Conditions#Invisible|invisible]]. Anything the target is carrying or wearing is also invisible as long as it remains in the target’s possession. The spell’s effects end for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels**
Target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

# Rare Versions
## _**Ravjahani’s Imparted Invisibility.**_ 
Until the spell ends, any object that the target picks up becomes [[Conditions#Invisible|invisible]] even after it is dropped.

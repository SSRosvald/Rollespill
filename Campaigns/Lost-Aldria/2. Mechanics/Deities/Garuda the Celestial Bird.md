## Motivation and Philosophy
Garuda's primary motivation is to maintain balance in the world, ensuring that power is wielded justly and that the weak are protected from the strong. He believes that power should be tempered with wisdom and that those who possess great power have a duty to protect others.

His philosophy is built on the following tenets:

1. **Strength Through Unity:** True power is derived not from individual might but from the collective strength of those who stand together. Garuda encourages his followers to form strong bonds and alliances, believing that communities are stronger when they are united.
    
2. **Guardianship:** Garuda teaches that those who are powerful have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable. He despises those who use their power for selfish gain or to oppress others.
    
3. **Ascendancy Through Struggle:** Garuda believes that true greatness is achieved through overcoming challenges. He encourages his followers to face adversity head-on, as he sees struggle as a path to growth and enlightenment.
    
4. **The Sky as the Limit:** Garuda symbolizes the boundless potential of his followers. He teaches that there are no limits to what one can achieve with determination and the right guidance.

## Abilities
- **Aegis of the Sky:**  
    Garuda can manifest an impenetrable shield made of pure wind and divine energy, capable of protecting entire cities or armies from harm. This shield is not just a physical barrier but also wards off curses and dark magic.

- **Stormborne Ascendancy:**  
    Garuda can grant the power of flight to his followers, allowing them to soar through the skies like eagles. This ability is often temporary, bestowed during times of great need or as a blessing for faithful service.

- **Wrath of the Tempest:**  
    As the embodiment of power, Garuda can summon storms and hurricanes at will. His most feared ability is to call down bolts of divine lightning, smiting those who oppose him or his followers. This ability is often used sparingly, reserved for the most dire of situations.

- **Wings of Vigilance:**  
    Garuda's wings are not just for flight; they are a symbol of his omnipresence. He can send forth spiritual versions of his wings to watch over his followers, providing them with protection and guidance even from afar.

- **Mantle of the Sky King:**  
    In battle, Garuda can channel the collective power of the skies, becoming a force of nature. He can control the wind, manipulate gravity, and move with blinding speed. This ability makes him nearly unstoppable, especially when defending those under his protection.

## Methods
- **Skyward Offerings:**  
    Followers often make offerings by releasing them into the sky. This could include releasing birds, kites, or even ashes carried by the wind. The act symbolizes sending their prayers directly to Garuda, who resides in the heavens.

- **Windborne Hymns:**  
    Garuda’s followers gather on high peaks or open fields where the wind is strong, singing hymns that are carried by the breeze. These hymns are believed to reach Garuda faster, especially during storms when the wind is most powerful.

- **Guardians’ Vigil:**  
    To invoke Garuda’s protection, his followers often participate in a vigil where they stand watch over their community or family throughout the night. During this time, they meditate on their responsibilities and the strength needed to protect those under their care.

- **Flight Rituals:**  
    On holy days, followers of Garuda engage in rituals that involve flight, either through magical means or by leaping from high places with gliders. These rituals are symbolic of their faith in Garuda’s protection and their aspiration to rise above earthly concerns.

- **Storm Prayer:**  
    During storms, followers believe Garuda is closest to the mortal realm. They will often stand in the rain or storm, chanting prayers and asking for his guidance or intervention in their lives. The lightning and thunder are seen as Garuda’s responses to their prayers.

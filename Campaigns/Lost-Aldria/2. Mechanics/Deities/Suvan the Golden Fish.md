## Motivation and Philosophy
Suvan’s motivations are rooted in her dual nature as both a fierce protector of the sea and a loving, compassionate deity. Her love for Hanuman, despite their initial opposition, reflects her belief in the transformative power of love and the idea that even the fiercest of tempests can calm when touched by true affection.

Her philosophy centers around the following principles:

1. **The Depths of Compassion:** Suvan teaches that love is the most powerful force in the world, capable of overcoming any obstacle. She encourages her followers to love deeply and fearlessly, even when it seems impossible or forbidden.

2. **Harmony with the Sea:** Suvan believes in living in harmony with the ocean, respecting its power and bounty. She opposes those who seek to exploit or harm the sea, viewing it as a sacred, living entity deserving of reverence.

3. **Strength in Vulnerability:** Suvan embodies the idea that true strength comes from embracing one's emotions and vulnerabilities. She teaches that it is not weakness to feel deeply, but rather a sign of one's connection to the world and others.

4. **The Duality of Tempests:** Just as the sea can be both gentle and fierce, Suvan believes that balance in life requires an understanding of both love and conflict. She guides her followers to navigate the storms of life with grace and resilience, knowing that calm will follow.

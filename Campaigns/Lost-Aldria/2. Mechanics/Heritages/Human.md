# Human
Human beings are remarkable creatures who, despite their short life span and limited inherent supernatural abilities, produce the noblest heroes and the most vile villains. Human build (and body hair) is some- where between that of elves and dwarves, yet humans stand taller than either. Their skin and hair color can be dark as jet or light as alabaster. Human hair can also be bright red and pale yellow — other hair colors may be the result of dye, magic, or a distant non-human ancestor like an elf, dragon, or giant. 

The origin of human beings is contentious. Many human cultures believe that their god created humanity. The question of which story and which god is the most true is a source of endless strife. 

When looking at how short-lived, nonmagical, and vulnerable humans are, one may be hard-pressed to say what exactly makes humans so successful. Some creatures even look down on humans as vermin. The human instinct to survive by the most expedient means available does not help this stereotype — although it helps one to see how such unremark- able creatures persist in mysterious and unfor- giving worlds.
### Human Traits

It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

***Ability Score Increase***. Your ability scores each increase by 1.

***Age***. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment***. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

***Size***. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

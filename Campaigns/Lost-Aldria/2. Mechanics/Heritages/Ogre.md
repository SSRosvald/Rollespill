## Ogre gifts
In addition to the traits found in your galeoni heritage, select one of the following gifts

### Vicious Maw

Some Ogre are especially Vicious. You have the following traits:

_**Rending Bite.**_ Your jaws are especially effective. Your bite attack is a natural weapon that deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier and must make a Constitution [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") or take ongoing damage equal to your Strength modifier. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw to end the effect. The DC for these saving throws equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus.

_**To the Bitter End.**_ When you take massive damage that would kill you instantly, you can use your reaction to make a death [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") . If the saving throw succeeds, you instead fall [unconscious](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") and are dying.

### Watchful Power

_**Sharp Eye.**_ You are considered proficient in the [Wary Stance](https://a5e.tools/node/754 "Click to view a local node.") maneuvre and do not have to spend exertion to activate it.

**_Stone's Endurance._** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

_**Vigilant.**_ A creature attacking you does not gain [advantage](https://a5e.tools/node/130 "Click to view a local node.") from being hidden from you or unseen by you.

As an action, you bare your teeth at a creature that you can see within 30 feet and let out a terrifying cry. If the creature can see or hear you, it must make a Wisdom [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or become [frightened](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") of you until the beginning of your next turn.

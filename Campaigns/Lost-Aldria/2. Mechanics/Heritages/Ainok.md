# Ainok
Ainokene er en humanoid folkerasene som dukket opp i fjellområdene nord for Qal-sisma slettene, men under den tidligste tiden med kaos under Tiamats barn, emigrerte mange ned til de sørlige sanddyner. De større typene som lignet på mastiffer eller bjørner er i hovedsak jaktet til nærmest utryddelse av sultne drager. De som lignet ulver og sjakaler er mer vanlige

## Ainok traits
Characters with the ainok heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.

**Age.** When they mature, they can reach nearly 60 years old

**Size.** An ainok can be anywhere from 4 to 6 feet high and weigh between 80 and 250 pounds. Your size is Medium

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Helpful**. When using the Help action to aid an ally in combat, the range at which you can do so is 30 feet

**Sharp Scent.** You are marvelously well- equipped to sniff out things around you. You gain an expertise die to Perception checks involving smell and other rolls where scent is important

**Wagging Tail**. An ainok rarely wins at cards due to their obvious tell. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks, but a d4 is subtracted from the results of your Deception checks.

## Ainok gifts

### Pack Hunter
Even more than most ainok, you are able to work in sync with others. You have the following trait: 
  **Teamwork**. You may take the Help action as a bonus action during combat.

### Lupine predator
You are able to slow things down and fully focus on a task at hand.
  **Lupine Focus.** As a bonus action you may focus totally upon the task at hand. So long as you do not move from the spot you are on and no enemies are within 5 feet of you, your movement score becomes zero and you gain an expertise die on the first D20 roll you make this turn. In addition, whilst you are focusing in this way, you gain an expertise die on concentration rolls caused by the object or creature you are focusing on.

### Sight Hound
Like certain dog breeds, some ainok have wiry frames built for speed and jumping. You have the following trait: 
 **Bounding Return.** As a bonus action, you can take the Dash action but must be within 5 feet of an ally at some point during that movement whilst doing so. In addition, when jumping, you are not required to move 10 feet to gain your full jump distance or height

## Ainok Paragon 
When you reach 8th level, you become a better ainok and gain one paragon gift from the following list.

### Peerless Tracker  
Your expertise die for scent-related rolls becomes a d6. Additionally, once you’ve caught a scent you can track it to a near-supernatural degree, such as following tracks over open water or through anything other than a surface impermeable to air. If you have an item personal to a creature you wish to track, for the next hour you have advantage on Perception or Survival checks made to find it. ![[Longshot Squad (Wesley Burt) [KTK] {140}.jpg|left|200]]

Finally, you can also cast locate object a number of times a day equal to your proficiency bonus, recovering all uses on a long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

### Boon Companion
So long as you are with a creature you consider an ally, you gain advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, when a creature that is 10 feet or more away from an ally makes an attack roll against that ally, you may use your reaction to move up to half your Speed to interpose yourself between the ally and the creature. The attack is then considered to be targeting only you, even if that would not normally be possible, and proceeds as normal, which may cause the attack roll to miss. If half your Speed is not enough to interpose yourself, you cannot use this feature. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, you can’t use it again until you have finished a long rest.

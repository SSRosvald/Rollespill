# `=this.file.name`
## Overview


## Requirements and Restrictions

**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Effects

When you roll dice to determine the damage of a spell which does area-of-effect damage (circle, cone, cube, cylinder, line, sphere, or square), your damage dice explode. This means that you can reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast a _fireball_ and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you roll an additional 3d6, and continue to reroll any 6s adding them to the total damage dealt.

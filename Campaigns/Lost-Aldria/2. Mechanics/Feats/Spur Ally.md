**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Overview
Beginning at 9th level, when an ally you can see who can hear or see you fails fails an ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to make them reroll. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
In addition, you learn an additional Maneuver.

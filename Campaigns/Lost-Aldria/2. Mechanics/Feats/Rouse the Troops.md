**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Overview
You can spend 1 minute speaking words of encouragement and support to reinvigorate your companions. Each friendly creature that can hear or understand you can spend any number of hit dice to regain hit points without having to finish a short rest. In addition, each creature that does spend at least one Hit Die in this way can remove one level of fatigue or strife it is suffering from. Once a creature has removed a level of fatigue or strife from your use of this class feature, the creature must finish a long rest before it can do so again.
In addition, the range of your [[Marshal#Commanding Presence|Commanding Presence]] is increased by 10 feet.

**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Overview

Your gales can harm even those typically resilient to them. Air and Storm damage from your spells treats [immunity](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") to them as though it were [resistance](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") , and ignores Air and Storm resistance entirely. Additionally, you gain resistance to Air and Storm damage, and you ignore Air and Storm damage dealt by your own spells

By creating a gale large enough to launch you into the air (taking no damage), you can cast _[[dream]]_ , with yourself as the messenger. If the gale dies down before you end the spell, you take 4d6 psychic damage and the spell ends. After casting it in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

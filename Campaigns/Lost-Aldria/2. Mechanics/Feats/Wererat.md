# Rodent Embraced
## Overview

You have completely mastered the rat within and learned tricks to make your lycanthropy an even greater asset in combat. You can transform one additional time without suffering a level of fatigue.

***Full Moon Defense.*** You gain immunity against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from weapons that are not magical or silvered. 

***Nose for Opportunity.*** When an ally strikes a creature you can see with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move up to your Speed, ending your move adjacent to that creature and making a melee weapon attack against it. If the creature is bloodied and the attack hits, you score a critical hit. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

***Wererat Trickery.*** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a bite attack, you can use your reaction to take the Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.

By acting as the party’s cook and quartermaster, with a cook’s utensils or Survival check an adventurer can help ensure that everybody remains fed. You can use up to three different ingredients when cooking. Ingredients are not limited to meat.

***Critical Failure.*** For every two creatures being fed, the Supply requirement to feed them is increased by 1 Supply. 
***Failure.*** The cooking is adequate, but has no special effects. 
***Success.*** For each day spent doing this journey activity, the Supply requirement to feed 4 creatures eating the meal is reduced by 1 Supply. You also gain the benefit  of up to two of the ingredients.
***Critical Success.*** As a success, and each creature being fed gains one additional hit die to spend on each day they are fed by the adventurer. You also gain the effect of all the chosen ingredients.

## Monster Types
By cooking the flesh of fallen foes, the adventurers may be able to gain additional short term boons.

**Aberrations** are not meant for mortal stomachs. Make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you gain 60ft. telepathy for the next 24 hours, and +1 hit point for every hit die used during a short rest. On a failure, take 2d6 psychic damage and gain a random form of long-term madness, as described on page 260 of the DMG.

**Beasts** make nice, normal meals, that normal people eat. Gain +1 hit point for every hit die used during a short rest.

**Celestials** are nearly impossible to eat, and extremely not recommended if you somehow manage it. What's wrong with you? Gain +3 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level, and your alignment permanently changes to evil if it wasn't there already. Celestials will recognize you as an enemy on sight, forever.

**Constructs** are inedible, unless you can eat rock or metal or whatever the construct happens to be made out of.

**Dragons** are the ultimate meat for any true monster chef. If the dragon is a true dragon, regain all hit points, and gain a one-use breath weapon equivalent to the dragonborn breath weapon of the same color. Otherwise, gain +3 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest.

**Elementals** are inedible. You can drink a dead water elemental, but it won't confer any bonuses.

**Fey** eat people all the time, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Gain +2 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest, and you gain one casting of _Misty Step_, which must be used within the next 24 hours.

**Fiends** usually dissolve into foul ichor when slain outside of their native plane, so a prospective fiend-eater will have to travel to the lower planes and eat a fiend there. If you somehow manage to pull this off, which is an extremely bad idea, take 8d6 necrotic damage. You gain one casting of _Summon Greater Demon_ as a 4th-level spell, which must be used within the next 24 hours. The demon is immediately hostile upon summoning, and lasts for an hour or until reduced to 0 hit points.

**Giants** are at least somewhat intelligent, but ogre meat is too good for you to question if this is cannibalism or not. Gain +2 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest, and you gain one casting of _Enlarge/Reduce_, which must be used within the next 24 hours. You can only use this spell to cast Enlarge, and can only target yourself.

**Humanoids** _definitely_ count as cannibalism, so you must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or vomit up the meat (assuming you are in fact a humanoid). Gain +2 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest, if you pass.

**Monstrosities** make up the bulk of a monster cook's dishes. Gain +2 hit points for every hit die used during a short rest.

**Oozes** are inedible, and usually corrosive. Don't try.

**Plants** are an extremely normal meal. Somewhat less so if they were just alive and thrashing about. +1 hit point for every hit die used during a short rest.

**Undead** are disgusting and inedible, unless they were alive until very recently (and are still corporeal). In this case, use the rules for whatever it was in life, and take 2d12 necrotic damage.

## harvesting the meats
But how will we humble adventurers be able to obtain the previously mentioned meats? Well be ye in luck today young adventurer, for I will tell you. If you are proficient with [[cook's utensils]], you roll against the AC of the slain foe following the chart below, and obtain that many d4 servings up to a maximum amount.

## Profile
**What to write:**  
A concise summary of the entity you’re profiling (e.g., a character, faction, or region). Include key identifying details: name, purpose, notable traits, and their role in the world.  
**Example:**

- **Name:** The Emberwood
- **Type:** Enchanted forest
- **Purpose:** A mysterious sanctuary for exiled magical beings.
- **Traits:** Trees that glow faintly at night; unpredictable magical effects within its borders.

## Story
**What to write:**  
The narrative or history associated with the entity. Consider their major events, turning points, or legends tied to them.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood is said to have emerged after a magical explosion during the War of the Shattered Staff. It now serves as a refuge but is rumored to have a guardian spirit that tests intruders.

## Philosophy
Klanen bruker lite magi, men magien de bruker er gjernhe kombinert med bueskyting i en farlig kunst kalt Dakla (Gloom-stalker / Hunter ranger). De bruker mye sniketaktikker, og Horden har noen "klan-påbud".
	Å erobre er å spise.
	Å regjere er å blø.
	Seier eller død.
Ingen i Horden har sine fødte navn, men alle tar et krigsnavn når de presterer en brutal ære.

**What to write:**  
The underlying values, beliefs, or ideologies that define the entity. Think about their moral code, worldview, or motivations.  
**Example:**

- The exiled inhabitants of the Emberwood believe in "the harmony of the outcast," valuing unity among those rejected by society. They oppose oppressive systems.
 
 Horden annerkjenner hurtighet som den viktigste egenskapen for å kunne overleve denne dystre og farlige verden.

## Relationships
Horden i sin helhet er avskydd av alle som bor i deres grenseland. Dette stammer mest sannsynlig fra misforståelser og mangel på forståelse av hverandres kulturer.
**What to write:**  
Connections and interactions with other entities in the world. This can include allies, enemies, trade partners, or cultural exchanges.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood’s denizens are wary of the nearby Kingdom of Ashveil, which hunts magical creatures. However, they maintain secret trade routes with the nomadic Skyfolk.

## Organization
Horden styres av en Orc kjent som [[Hjelmknuser]], og en Goblin kalt [[Ankelslynger]]. 
**What to write:**  
How the entity is structured or operates. For a character, this could be their personal habits; for a faction, it might cover leadership, hierarchy, or governing systems.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood operates through a council of magical beings called "The Whispering Grove." Decisions are made by consensus, guided by the forest’s spirit.

## Resources
**What to write:**  
The physical, magical, or intellectual assets available to the entity. Include rare materials, technologies, or knowledge they can access.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood produces glowing sap with healing properties. Its trees are a source of "ethereal wood," which can amplify spells.

## Methods
**What to write:**  
The strategies or tactics the entity uses to achieve goals or solve problems. This can include fighting styles, diplomacy, or magical techniques.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood’s inhabitants use guerrilla tactics and illusions to protect their sanctuary, avoiding direct confrontations whenever possible.

## Background
**What to write:**  
A detailed history or origin story. Expand on what shaped the entity, including pivotal moments, cultural influences, or external pressures.  
**Example:**

- The Emberwood began as an ordinary forest but was forever changed when the War of the Shattered Staff ravaged the land. Magical fallout infused the region, making it a haven for those sensitive to magic.

## Additional Details
**What to write:**  
Anything that doesn’t fit into the other sections but adds flavor or depth. This could be folklore, quirks, rumors, or tidbits that make the entity unique.  
**Example:**

- It’s whispered that the trees of the Emberwood sing at dawn, but only those pure of heart can hear their song.
### Gender Roles
All males are warriors, and all females are every other roles in society. This concervative view is so rigid that it loops back around to be almost progressive. When a child is young, they are assigned roles in society based on their birth gender. If the child does not succeed within this role, they are assigned roles for the 'other' gender. This results in a society where every warrior, whether they are male or female in appearance, are assigned male, whilst every Artisan, Caregiver and other type of professional is assigned female.

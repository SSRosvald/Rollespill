# Dimension door
## Overview

Throughout the process of honing your body and mind, your keen senses revealed folds within the very firmament of reality— anomalies that you have learned how to exploit to move between increasingly distant points with just a step. You gain the following special focus feature:

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisite***: *3 levels in [[adept]], 3 levels in [[rogue]]*

## Effects

Dimensional Step. Once on your turn, you can use a reaction to spend up to a number of exertion points equal to your proficiency bonus to teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see at a cost of 1 exertion point per 10 feet of distance. Additionally, each time you teleport you can choose to appear in your chosen space lightly obscured by a 5-foot square area of fog, allowing you to immediately take the Hide action. The fog dissipates at the start of your next turn or can be dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour).

# Teleporting Combatant
## Overview

The more you step through reality’s folds, the easier it becomes. You can forgo your movement during your turn to instead spend exertion to use Dimensional Step an additional time, though its range is limited to a number of feet equal to your movement speed when used in this way.

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisite***: *Dimensional Step feat*

## Effects

In addition, you can spend double the number of exertion points when using Dimensional Step to take a single adjacent creature of your size or smaller with you, as long as there is enough unoccupied space. An unwilling creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your focus save DC, teleporting with you on a failed save and taking damage equal to 2d8 + your proficiency bonus on a success. Unwilling targets can only be teleported onto solid surfaces; for example, any attempt to teleport them into the air or into water immediately fails. In this case, you teleport without them, spending exertion as normal.

# Crawling Teleporter
## Overview

Not only does your ability to step between reality’s folds become as easy as walking, your control over this unique power becomes so complete that you can place the ground beneath your feet no matter what the surface, enabling you to safely teleport onto walls, ceilings, and the like.

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisite***: *Teleporting Combatant feat*

## Effects

You also gain the Spider Climb feature. 

**Spider Climb.** You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed, and you can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.

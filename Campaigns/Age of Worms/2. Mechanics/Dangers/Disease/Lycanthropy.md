# Lycanthropy
## Overview

A lycanthrope is a humanoid who transforms into an animal during the full moon. In animal form, a lycanthrope (also called a were) appears to be simply a large, powerful example of its species. Its eyes, however, betray its humanoid intelligence. 

Viewed separately as a disease, a curse, a blessing, or a bloodline, lycanthropy is spread through the bites of lycanthropes or from a parent to child at birth. The most common varieties of lycanthropes are werebears, wereboars, wererats, weretigers, and werewolves.

## Becoming Afflicted

***The Curse of Lycanthropy.*** Any humanoid bitten by a lycanthrope in its animal or hybrid form can contract lycanthropy. Lycanthropy inflicted in this way can be cured with a *[[remove curse]]* spell, but a person born a lycanthrope is one by nature, and only a *[[wish]]* spell can remove the curse. 

On the night of the first full moon after being bitten (or, for a natural lycanthrope, upon reaching young adulthood), a person involuntarily changes into an animal. This transformation is painful and draining, leaving the afflicted hungry, unable to speak, and often confused and frightened. During the transformation, a lycanthrope’s thoughts are filled with predatory instincts. Many newly changed lycanthropes attack others out of hunger or fear. Others surrender to their bestial natures, reveling in the hunt and the kill.

## Effects

***Involuntary Change.*** You undergo a draining and painful involuntary change every full moon that leaves you hungry, unable to speak, and often confused and frightened. During the 1 minute transformation your statistics are replaced by those of a lycanthrope (as presented in Monstrous Menagerie), the Narrator takes control over your actions, and your thoughts are filled with predatory instincts. 

When an involuntary change happens, you can either embrace the beast within or try to tame it. 

***Embrace:*** You lose all control over your actions until sunrise, but you retain your full memories the following day. 

***Tame:*** You make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you regain control over your actions for 1 hour. At the end of every hour, you repeat the saving throw. On a failure, you lose all control over your actions until sunrise and have no memories of what you did during the night. 

***Hybrid Form.*** As an action, you can transform into animal form or into a half-humanoid, half-animal hybrid form. This transformation is no less painful than an involuntary change, but you retain full control over your actions. You can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. You can transform into hybrid form and back once per long rest with no ill effects, and you suffer a level of fatigue for every subsequent transformation. 

***Statistics.*** While transformed into animal or hybrid form, your statistics change in the following ways.
- Your Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. 
- You cannot speak or cast spells. 
- Any features or traits from your class, destiny, or culture are unaffected if your current form is physically capable of using them. However, you can’t utilize any traits gained from your heritage while transformed. 
- Your equipment does not transform with you. Any clothes or armor are destroyed if you transform while wearing them.

***Wolfsbane Weakness.*** While in hybrid or beast form you are poisoned while within 10 feet of a living or dried wolfsbane flower that you can smell.

## Prevention and Recovery

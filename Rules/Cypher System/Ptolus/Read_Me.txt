Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spirehttp://www.ptolus.comDon't simply open this ebook file and hit "Print"! Due to its huge size (more than 80 MB, 808 pages), the file takes a long time to spool on most printers before printing; trying to print the whole thing all at once may cause your printer to hang up. You will achieve better results by printing the book in smaller segments of around 32 pages, rather than all at once.We've created a page design that is as ink-conservative as possible. If you're still concerned about ink usage, make sure your printer is set to "Speed" rather than "High Quality" printouts. You may want to change your printer settings to black-and-white to save on color ink, and only print the sections you really need.While Ptolus looks just fine as a single-sided printout, the layout was designed for double-sided printing. Start your double-sided printing with an even-numbered page to maintain proper pagination.You can use the bookmarks (see the tab on the left side of the PDF) to navigate through the document quickly.Hope you enjoy the book!Thanks, Malhavoc Presscustomerservice@montecook.com(c) Copyright 2007 Monte J.

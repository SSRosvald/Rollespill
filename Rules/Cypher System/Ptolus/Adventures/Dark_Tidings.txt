Dark Tidingshttp://www.montecook.comPlease read this before you print Dark Tidings. We've created a page design that is as ink-conservative as possible. If you're still concerned about ink usage, make sure your printer is set to "Speed" rather than "High Quality" printouts. You may want to change your printer settings to black-and-white to save on color ink, or simply not print the covers (pages 1 and 21).While Dark Tidings looks just fine as a single-sided printout, the layout was designed for double-sided printing. Start your double-sided printing with page 2 to maintain proper pagination, and print the front cover separately.You can use the bookmarks (see the tab on the left side of the PDF) to navigate through the document quickly.Hope you enjoy the book!Thanks, Malhavoc Presscustomerservice@montecook.com(c) Copyright 2009 Monte J.

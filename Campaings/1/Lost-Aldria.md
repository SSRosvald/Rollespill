# Lost-Aldria
Tiamat har falt/gått i dvale, men hennes fem barn har klekket, og lagt kontinentet under seg. Folket er separert, og utvikler egne former for å bekjempe dragene. Dette skaper splid og uenighet, og selv med truslen av drager, klarer ikke fraksjonene å skape enighet seg imellom heller.

## Champion

*Bountiful and overrated. You can't spit in this realm without hitting one. I have witnessed the birth, death, and unlife of more champions than I dare recount. Few are worth remembering.*— Mordenkainen

Champions are mighty warriors who have honed their fighting skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.

A typical champion bears a coat of arms, heraldry that is associated with the champion far and wide. You may create a coat of arms for a champion or roll on the Champion's Coats of Arms table to determine it.

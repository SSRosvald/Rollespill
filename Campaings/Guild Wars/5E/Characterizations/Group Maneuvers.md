	"The line in the sand has been drawn. Valen, a hulking dragonborn, stands toe to toe with the grinning halflingknown as Tella, ready to see their feud through to its bitter end. As Valen commits to a powerful charge, Tella lets out a piercing whistle, calling her gnomish ally out from the shadows and into the fray. As she sidesteps the dragonborn’s charge, she grabs Valen’s forearm and torso and pulls him with ease over her now-prone ally, forcing the dragonborn into an embarrassing stumble to the floor."

Group maneuvers introduce new reactions that allow
creatures to work with their allies to manipulate the flow
of combat. These lightweight mechanics are designed to
be available to all creatures big and small—even foes and
monsters!
## Learning Maneuvers
When using this system, each character can learn a number of maneuvers of their choice equal to their proficiency
bonus. The options are listed under “Maneuvers” later in
the article. These maneuvers can be introduced at character creation, or as part of an ongoing campaign as part
of the narrative or as a group reward. You learn new maneuvers as your proficiency bonus increases. When you
gain a level, you can replace one maneuver you know with
another from the list.
### Downtime Activity: Training Montage
A GM can allow player characters to study maneuvers during downtime. Two or more characters can choose
to study together. It typically takes 5 days of dedicated
practice to train each maneuver, and anyone who participates in the training can choose to learn the maneuver at the end of that time. In order to learn a maneuver during downtime, you must have a dedicated teacher who knows the maneuver or a scroll that guides you through the process of learning the maneuver.
#### Complications
Optionally, the GM can introduce complications to your downtime activity.
Practicing maneuvers is an interactive activity between
two or more people. You have a 10 percent chance to encounter a complication during each day of practice. When a complication arises, the GM can choose or roll for the complication on the Training Montage Complications table.

|  1  | You have difficulty finding a set of instructions for the specific maneuver you are trying to learn, forcing<br>you to spend 5 days finding a teacher before you can begin practice.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  2  | Others witnessing your training mistake it for an actual fight, and the authorities come to break up the “altercation.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Roleplaying a Maneuver 
Using a maneuver is a chance to create memorable moments with your friends. Coordinate with your team in advance: “James, please use your Clever feature as a bonus action! I’m probably going to miss with one of the attacks from my scorching ray, so get ready to redirect it!”
To encourage this behavior as a GM, don’t be afraid to give out inspiration for successful tactics and hilarious mistakes, or simply have an enemy drop dead from embarrassment after falling victim to a Tabletop Trip.
## Using Maneuvers
A maneuver is executed by using your reaction in response
to a predefined trigger—an activity being performed by an
ally that you can see or hear—to combine your efforts into
an effect greater than the sum of its parts.
#### Maneuver Saving Throw DC
If a maneuver requires your target to make a saving throw,
the DC is calculated as follows:
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier (your
choice)
### [[Inspiration]] 
You can use inspiration in a new way with group maneu-
vers to create truly awe-inspiring moments. If you have in-
spiration when you perform a maneuver, you can expend
the inspiration to perform the maneuver without using a
reaction. In addition, you and your ally have advantage
on any attack rolls or ability checks you make as part of
the maneuver, and your target has disadvantage on any
saving throws made to avoid or resist it.
## Maneuvers
The group maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
### Alley-oop
When an ally you can see or hear disarms a creature within 5 feet of you and causes it to drop an object, you can use your reaction to either pick up the object, provided you have a free hand to do so, or kick it up to 20 feet
away.
You can also use your reaction after an ally you can see or hear scores a critical hit against a creature within 5 feet of you to disarm that creature, forcing it to drop an object of your choice that it’s holding. As part of this
maneuver, you can pick up the object up or kick it up to 20 feet away.
### Arcane Echo
***Prerequisite:*** *[[Pact Magic]] or [[Spellcasting]] feature*
When an ally you can see or hear within 30 feet of you
casts a spell that you also know or have prepared with a
casting time of 1 action and a range of self that targets an
area (such as thunderwave), you can use your reaction
and expend a spell slot of the triggering spell’s level (a
minimum of a 1st-level slot) to echo the spell, casting it
yourself. If the areas of the spells overlap, a target in the
overlapping area is affected only by the first spell cast.
### Catapult Jump
When an ally within 5 feet of you who weighs less than 30
times your Strength score jumps, you can use your reac-
tion to launch them farther. The distance they are able to
jump doubles, and every 2 feet of movement during their
jump costs only 1 foot.

### Charged Projectile
***Prerequisite:*** *You can cast a [[cantrip]] that requires an attack roll*
When an ally makes a ranged weapon attack and you are
within 5 feet of the target or the attacker, you can use your reaction to cast a cantrip to charge the projectile. The cantrip must be one that requires an attack roll and targets only one creature, and it is cast as if you were a 1st-level spellcaster. If the attack hits, the target is also hit
by the cantrip.
### Cross Strike
When an ally you can see or hear hits a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the target. On a hit, instead of suffering the normal effects of your attack, the target takes damage of your weapon’s
type equal to the ability modifier used for your attack roll. Hit or miss, both you and your ally can move up to half your speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.
### Diversion
After an ally you can see or hear hits a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, you can move up to half your speed as a reaction. The target of the attack can’t use their reaction to make an opportunity attack against you.
### Dogpile
When a creature within 5 feet of you makes a Dexterity saving throw against a spell cast or effect created by an ally, you can use your reaction to attempt to grapple the target. On a success, the target is grappled as normal and also has disadvantage on the Dexterity saving throw.
### Get Down
***Prerequisite:*** *[[Evasion]] feature*
When you and an ally within 5 feet of you both make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage from an effect or spell, you can use your reaction to cause the friendly creature to take only the same amount of damage that you do.
### Hail of Arrows
When you are wielding a ranged weapon and an ally makes a ranged weapon attack against a target you can see that is within your weapon’s range, you can use your reaction to join in the attack. Your ally makes their at-
tack roll with advantage, and if the attack hits, you can roll your weapon’s damage dice and add the total to the damage dealt.
### Juggler
When an ally you can see makes a ranged attack with a thrown weapon against a target within 5 feet of you and you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to toss the weapon back to your ally. Once you’ve used your reaction to execute this maneuver, you can repeat it any number of times without using your reaction until the end of the
turn.
### Reflect Magic
***Prerequisite:*** *The [[Deflect Missiles]] feature or the ability to cast at least one spell*
If an ally makes a ranged spell attack against a target within 10 feet of you and misses, you can use your reaction to redirect the magic back toward the target. Make a new attack roll using your proficiency bonus and your Dexterity or spellcasting ability modifier (your choice).
### Spotter
When an ally that can see or hear you makes a ranged attack against a target that is behind half cover or three-quarters cover for them but isn’t behind cover for you, you can use your reaction to guide their strike. Your
ally’s attack ignores half cover or three-quarters cover.
### Tabletop Trip
When an ally you can see pushes or pulls a creature that starts the movement from within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to fall prone in the creature’s path. If the target is your size or one size larger, it stumbles and falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or the nearest unoccupied space.
### Whirling Magic
***Prerequisite:*** *The ability to cast at least one spell*
When an ally you can see or hear within 30 feet of you makes a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to enchant your ally’s weapon, allowing them to create a damaging burst of force with their weapon instead. In lieu of the attack, your ally can force each creature within 5 feet of themself to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to a damage
roll made with the weapon, plus additional force damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.

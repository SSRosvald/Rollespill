**[Javelin of Lightning](https://5e.tools/items.html#javelin%20of%20lightning_dmg)**
This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.

**Thrown.**
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
### Background
In the bustling city of [[Greveskapet Randhilborg]], where the streets were always teeming with people, two unlikely beings met. Hariaz, a male dwarf, was a brilliant researcher who spent most of his days poring over ancient texts and manuscripts in the city's archives. [[Gav Riuwyw Viddyh]], on the other hand, was a male tiefling who worked in the local theatre, where he dazzled audiences with his captivating performances.

One day, as Hariaz was making his way back from the archives, he stumbled upon a street performer who had attracted a sizable crowd. As he tried to make his way through the throngs of people, he noticed a figure standing at the edge of the crowd, watching the performer with a keen eye. It was Gav, who had taken a break from his duties at the theatre to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city.

Their eyes met, and Hariaz felt a flutter in his chest that he had never experienced before. For his part, Gav was intrigued by the dwarf's rugged appearance and piercing blue eyes. They struck up a conversation, and before long, they found themselves lost in each other's company.

Over the next few weeks, they spent more and more time together, exploring the city and learning about each other's lives. Hariaz was fascinated by Gav's work in the theatre, and Gav was equally intrigued by Harias' research into the city's history.

As they got to know each other better, their feelings for each other grew stronger. They found themselves unable to resist the pull of their mutual attraction, and they soon became inseparable.

Despite the differences in their backgrounds, Hariaz and Gav found that they had much in common. They shared a deep love of learning and a passion for the arts, and they quickly became each other's biggest supporters.

Eventually, they decided to settle down together in Randhilborg, where they could pursue their passions and build a life together. Hariaz continued his research, uncovering new secrets about the city's past, while Gav continued to dazzle audiences at the theatre.

Their love only grew stronger with each passing day, and they found happiness in the simple pleasures of life. They were content to live in each other's company, surrounded by the vibrant culture of the city they had grown to love.

As they looked out over the bustling streets of Randhilborg, hand in hand, they knew that they had found their true home. Together, they had discovered a love that was as enduring as the city itself, and they knew that they would always be there for each other, no matter what the future held.

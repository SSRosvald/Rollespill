## Effects
You draw upon divine power and create a minor divine effect. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following:

• Your voice booms up to three times louder than normal
• You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color
• You send harmless tremors throughout the ground.
• You create an instantaneous sound, like ethereal chimes, sinister laughter, or a dragon’s roar at a point of your choosing within range.
• You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
• You alter the appearance of your eyes.

Lingering effects last until the spell ends. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to 3 of the lingering effects active at a time, and can dismiss an effect at any time on your turn.

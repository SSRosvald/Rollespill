## Effects
Grease erupts from a point that you can see within range and coats the ground in the target area, turning it into [difficult terrain](https://a5e.tools/rules/world-bonuses-penalties-and-cover "Click to view a local node.") until the spell ends.

When the grease appears, each creature within the area must succeed on a Dexterity [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") or fall [[Conditions#Prone|prone]]. A creature that enters or ends its turn in the area must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

# Rare Versions
## **_Katrinaâ€™s Flammable Grease._** 
Until the spell ends, a creature that has made a [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") against it gets grease on itself and becomes flammable. When the creature takes fire damage, it takes 1d6 ongoing fire damage until it uses an action to douse the flames.

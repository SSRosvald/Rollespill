An adventure is a collection of related encounters designed to fit together , creating a cogent storyline for  the game. Some adventures are only short chapters in the campaign or interludes between longer adventures. Other represent significant missions, while still others form the backbone of the campaign.
Don't confuse an adventure with a campaign! Each adventure, regardless of its length, should have a clearly defined goal. For short adventures, this goal may be very simple: Find the daughter of a nobleman along the borders and bring her back safely. Longer adventures may have more complex goals, or even multiple goals within the same adventure. A campaign, on the other hand, might not have a clear goal (particularly when it begins), but should have a theme or context. 

## Building an Adventure

Your games can categorize adventures as short, medium, or long. This describes the average number of encounters in the adventure, the number of typical 3-4 hour sessions required to run the adventure, and the average experience point award for the adventure.
Short adventures usually have a simple, straightforward goal, such as traveling overland from one city to another through a dangerous pass of mountains. A short adventure generally has three to five encounters. One or two of these encounters should be easy, with a similar number of medium encounters. No more than one encounter in a short adventure should be hard, and it's not necessary to have a hard encounter at all. A typical short adventure shouldn't allow significant resting periods; if it does, consider replacing one of the medium encounters with a hard encounter. Short adventures are ideal for a single 3-4 hour playing session.
Medium adventures represent significant missions for the heroes, but generally don't encompass large-scale events. Medium adventures typically have six to ten encounters. Half of the encounters in a medium adventure should be medium, with the remainder being evenly distributed between easy and hard encounters. A medium adventure should last 2-3 sessions.
Long adventures usually involve significant, even epic storylines. Long adventures have 12 to 15 encounters. Sometimes a long adventure may actually be a collection of short adventures or "chapters" allowing the tension to build through two or three "climactic" encounters (which should be hard or deadly encounters). As with a medium adventure, the typical long adventure should be about 50% medium encounters, with the remainder split between easy and hard encounters. Depending on the characters' ability to recuperate between encounters, this remainder might be evenly distributed between these two types or slanted towards one or the other. The long adventure will usually last four or more playing sessions.

## Awarding Experience

Experience points measure a hero's accomplishments. They allow a hero to gain levels and therefore become more powerful.
The Narrator awards each hero experience points (XP) at the conclusion of each [[How to Build an Adventure#Building an Adventure|adventure]]. This represents the fact  that the heroes have learned from their adventure and (probably) have time to reflect on their experiences and train their skills.
The number of XP awarded is based on the length of the adventure and the average level of the heroes who participated. In each case, the base XP award is multiplied by the average hero level, then divided between all the heroes who participated.

| **Adventure Length** | **Base XP Award** |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Short                | 300 XP            |
| Medium               | 600 XP            |
| Long                 | 1200 XP           |

## Description
Images of beasts, monstrosities, and other types of companion creatures are carved on the outside of this 3-inch-radius iron sphere. While you hold the ball and your companion is within 30 feet of you and not in a rampage, you can use an action to speak a command word to transport your companion inside the ball into a cozy, secure extradimensional space. While in the ball, your companion can take a short or long rest, and doesnâ€™t need to eat or drink. A [[companion ball]] can hold only one companion at a time.

As an action while holding the ball, you can speak the command word again to release your companion into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see.

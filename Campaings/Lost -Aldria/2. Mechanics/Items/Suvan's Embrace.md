## Description
When you activate these brass knuckles, you may add your Wisdom modifier as extra holy damage to attacks for up to ten minutes. You can do this equal to your proficiency modifier each day.

At first glance, the brass knuckles gleam with a lustrous sheen, adorned with intricate designs reminiscent of the swirling currents of the ocean depths. Each curve and contour of the knuckles pays homage to the graceful form of Suvan as she dances through the waves, a vision of elegance and power.

Etched along the handle is a mesmerizing depiction of Suvan, her ethereal beauty captured in fine detail, her eyes alight with mischief and intrigue. Surrounding her likeness are delicate motifs of seashells, pearls, and swirling waves, symbolizing her deep connection to the ocean realm.

But it is the centerpiece of these brass knuckles that truly sets them apartâ€”a striking representation of Suvan and Hanuman, entwined in an embrace against all odds. Their figures are sculpted in exquisite relief, frozen in a moment of unexpected tenderness amidst the chaos of their divergent paths.

## Construction
These brass knuckles are formed in a holy forge devoted to the Goddess [[Suvan the Golden Fish|Suvan]], made by the skeleton bone of a shark and blessed deep water metals.

Black water appears as a coal-black, sticky, and viscous liquid smelling strongly of vegetable rot, and is found in the insides of trees and other large plants (where it replaces [sap](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sap)), and in the ground, where it lies just below the topsoil. It is a magical substance that is a side product of [qlippoth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Qlippoth) runestone, and radiates a faint necromantic aura. Ingesting black water has the drug-like effects, as detailed below.

# Aven
## Aven traits

_**Age:**_ Aven reach physical maturity around age 20, when they shed their drab juvenile feathers for a new, adult coloration. It is very rare for them to live past 100 years.

**_Size:_** Aven often have lean builds. They stand between 5 to 7 feet tall, though due to their hollow bones they average 90 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**_Speed:_** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**_Avian Senses._** You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Perception checks that rely on sight or hearing.

**_Wind Rider._** Your arms function as protowings that allow you to glide safely to the ground. Each round you can move horizontally 5 feet for every 5 feet you descend, up to a distance equal to your speed. You cannot hover and so must move your full Speed each turn or land. Otherwise, you fall as normal. To use this movement, you cannot be encumbered and cannot wield a weapon. At the Narrator’s discretion you may be able to hold a small weapon, such as a dagger, or a small item, such as a potion, but cannot use them while gliding. Whenever you spend 3 full consecutive rounds gliding without landing, you gain a level of [fatigue](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") . Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a short or long rest.

Additionally, you have [resistance](https://a5e.tools/rules/damage-and-recovery "Click to view a local node.") to falling damage as long as you are not [incapacitated](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") .

## Aven gifts

Aven can vary greatly from each other. In addition to the traits found in your aven heritage, select one of the following gifts.

### Aspect of the Hunt

Aven especially in tune with birds of prey are never unarmed. You gain the following trait:

**_Sharp Talons._** Your talons are sharp enough to be used as deadly weapons. The talons are natural weapons with the finesse trait, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. They do not require an empty hand to use.

**_Darkvision._** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Wind Mastery

Rarely, a aven is born with true wings sprouting from their back, as well as tail feathers to help them fly. While not capable of sustained flight, such chicks are considered blessed and often go on to hold roles of spiritual or political significance. You gain the following trait:

**_Flight._** You gain a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of [fatigue](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") . Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

You can use your Wind Rider trait to glide on a following round, but if you resume flying before landing you gain fatigue as normal. Similarly, you can begin flying during a glide but are still subject to gaining fatigue if you resume gliding.

## Aven Paragon

As a aven matures, they achieve their full potential, boosting their innate abilities to higher levels. When you reach 8th level, your heritage gift improves considerably.

### Greater Aspect of the Hunt

The range of your darkvision increases to 120 feet and your talons’ damage die increases to 1d8. Additionally, you can now make an attack roll with your talons as a bonus action.

### Greater Wind Mastery

Your fly speed increases to 40 feet and you can fly while wearing medium or heavy armor. When you would suffer fatigue from using your fly speed, you make a Constitution [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") (DC 10 + 1 per previous save in the last minute). On a success, you do not suffer [fatigue](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") from flying that round and you do not suffer fatigue from flying that round.

# Djinn

Djinn folket dukket opp i fjellene nord på kontinentet, ikke i stand til å forklare hvem de var eller hvor de faktisk kom fra. De har humanoide trekk med blå-grå hud, store sorte øyne og horn. De ble ønsket velkommen med åpne armer inn i byene i Cori-land.

## Djinn traits

Characters with djinn heritage share the following traits.

**Age.**  Djinn typically mature at the same rate as humans but have slightly longer lifespans. 

**Size.**  Djinn are usually of similar build and size to humans. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base Speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Thanks to your supernatural origins, your vision is not impeded by darkened conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray

**Immortal Blessing.** Your connection with the source of your bloodline allows you to cheat death. When you would ordinarily be reduced to zero hit points, you are instead reduced to one hit point. You cannot use this feature again until you have finished a long rest

## Djinn gifts

Infused at birth with the basic building blocks of the universe, Djinn have a variety of ways to access these powerful elements. In addition to the traits found in your djinn heritage, select one of the following gifts.

### KongQi
![[Mistfire Weaver (Chris Rahn) [KTK] {46}.jpg|right|250]]
Connected to the Elemental Plane of Air, these djinn may have skin and hair the color of a sky on a sunny day, that of a cluster of stormclouds, or other light, cool tones. Some, on the other hand, may have a more avian aspect, with feathers instead of hair or the eyes of a bird of prey. You have the following traits: 

**Feather on the Wind.** When you fall, you can use your reaction to slow your rate of descent and land from a height of up to 60 feet without taking falling damage; you take half damage if falling from heights higher than that. 

**Light on Your Feet.** You can use a bonus action to make a leap of a distance up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This distance increases by 5 feet each time your proficiency bonus increases. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t use it again until you have finished a long rest. Additionally, when you would be knocked prone, you can use your reaction to instead move 5 feet in a direction you choose. This movement does not provoke an opportunity attack.

### Chen

As diverse as any djinn, chen djinn may have eyes the clear purple of a crystal or the deep brown-black of a rich field. Some among them are more obvious in their affinity, chunks of crystalline growths along their arms and skin the color of any soil one can imagine. You have the following traits: 

**Fists of Stone.** Your hands can become hard and rocky, perhaps even jagged and spiked. Causing this change or ending it requires no action. Your hands are hard as rock and serve as natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Each time you use this feature, choose piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. Your natural weapons deal damage of the chosen type equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. 

**Craggy Skin.** While you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Constitution modifier.

### Huo

A huo’s connection to their elemental plane almost always manifests in warm-hued hair and skin, to the point that some are mistaken for comparatively subtle tieflings and aasimar. Those with more flashy manifestations might have hair that undulates like a flame, or eyes the color of shifting embers. You have the following traits: 

**Fevered Blood.** You have resistance to fire damage. 

**Flame On.** When a creature touches you or successfully hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to briefly set your skin aflame. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. The creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw or half damage on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th level, and 6d6 at 19th level. 
Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Shui
![[Cunning Strike (Clint Cearley) [FRF] {150}.jpg|left|250]]
The shui djinn, true to their nature, often have aquatic features, though these can be as subtle as bright blue eyes or small patches of scales to needle-like teeth, prominent fins, and colorful skin in tones of blue, green, or even those of tropical fish. You have the following traits: 

**Gentle Ministrations.** Leveraging water’s power as a natural healing agent, you can use an action to touch a willing creature and restore a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you must finish a long rest before doing so again. 

**Liquid Undulation.** Your fluid movement grants you an expertise die to resist attempts to grapple you and to escape grapples. 

**Piscine Aspect.** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

## Djinn Paragon

 When you reach level 8, you become an exemplar among djinn and gain one paragon gift from the following list. Your chosen paragon gift must be of the same element as your chosen elemental gift

### Dominion of the Core (Chen) 
You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed. Additionally, if the surface you are climbing is unworked stone, you can walk on walls and upside down on ceilings. You also gain a burrowing speed equal to your Speed. You can use your burrowing speed to move through nonmagical unworked earth and stone without disturbing it. Finally, your natural weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures.

### Dominion of the Flame (Huo) 
You gain immunity to fire damage.

### Dominion of the Sky (KongQi) 
You gain a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor or using a heavy shield unless these items have the lightweight property and you can’t be encumbered. If your movement speed is reduced to 0, you fall but take half as much falling damage as normal. While using this speed, your carrying capacity is reduced to twice your Strength score, and flying for more than a minute may require a Constitution saving throw for a forced march. 
Additionally, you gain an expertise die to your maneuver DC attempting the Grapple and Knockdown maneuvers against flying creatures.

### Dominion of the Sea (Shui) 
Between long rests you gain the following ability a number of times equal to the sum of your Charisma and Constitution modifiers (minimum 1).
As an action, you can take on an even more prominent piscine aspect, growing fins, gills, and perhaps even changing the color or texture of your skin. Your swim speed increases by 30 feet, you can breathe underwater normally, and while underwater you gain darkvision to a distance of 120 feet and can take the Dodge and Hide actions as a bonus action. This is not a magical effect and does not change what clothes you are wearing or their appearance. You may end these changes as a bonus action.

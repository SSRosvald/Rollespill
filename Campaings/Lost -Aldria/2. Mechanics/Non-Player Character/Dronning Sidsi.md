  - name: Counterspell (3rd-Level; S). 
    desc: When a creature Sidsi can see within 60 feet casts a spell, she attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, Sidsi makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If Sisdi casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.
  - name: Shield (1st-Level; V, S).
    desc: When Sidsi is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.

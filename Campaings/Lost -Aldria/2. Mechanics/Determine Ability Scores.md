Every creature has six ability scores to describe their physical attributes and mental characteristics: Strength for physical power and prowess, Dexterity for agility and reflexes, Constitution for health and hardiness,  Intelligence for memory and wits, Wisdom for awareness and intuition, and Charisma for force of personality.

Ability scores define some of a creature’s qualities, assets, and weaknesses. The numbers in each of a creature’s ability scores measure a mixture of innate capability, training, and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the human average, and a truly exceptional person might have an 18 in an ability score. Adventurers often start their journeys with above average scores in some of their abilities, and through hardship and experience can reach scores as high as 20. Likewise, many monsters have above average ability scores, and the most powerful—such as ancient dragons and divine beings—can have scores as high as 30.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier, derived from its score, ranging from –5 (for a score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The table below lists the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30, but note only through extraordinary circumstances can a player character have an ability score below 8 or above 20.

The three main rolls of the game—ability checks, [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") , and [attack rolls](https://a5e.tools/rules/making-attack "Click to view a local node.") —rely on the ability modifiers derived from the six ability scores. Because ability modifiers affect almost every roll, they come up during play more often than their associated scores.

## The Other Six
The other six scores are as previously stated, a combination of two of the scores above.

| Ability 1    | Ability 2    | Secondary Ability |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Strength     | Constitution | Fortitude         |
| Dexterity    | Strength     | Athleticism       |
| Intelligence | Dexterity    | Initiative        |
| Wisdom       | Intelligence | Knowledge         |
| Charisma     | Wisdom       | Willpower         |
| Constitution | Charisma     | Glamour           |
### Fortitude
This is the numerical value of how hardy you are. This is the score you will look to whenever you gain a new level, which upon you will add this number to your health pool, in addition to your Hit dice. This number is also deeply connected to your ability to withstand poisons and other harm done to the physical being.
### Athleticism
This number is what you add to your Maneuver save DC in addition to your proficiency. Some skill checks may also be needed, when an action require more than just brute strength or dexterity.
### Initiative 
This number is your initiative. This is what you refer do at start of combat, or when you have to be quick witted.
### Knowledge 
This is the sum total of your knowledge. Just because you have not read about something in a book, you may have experienced it personally, or vice versa. This will help you recollect and deduct yourself to the answer needed. When a skill check doen require your knowledge, this is the number you will refer to. 
### Willpower 
This combination of Charisma and Wisdom represent your ability to stay head strong, to not waver, to withstand manipulation, of the magical kind, and not. This will replace the normal "will save check" in many instances, but can also be used as a contested check against to parties.
### Glamour 
Often, charisma has been used to determine someones beauty, but alas, no more. Your glamour is determined by your physical attributes, and your skills in smooth-talking, or not. How you hold yourself when trying to impress a noble, how you chat with the local barmaid, or how your immense size scares people around you, the time of charisma based saves to threaten is over. Enter GLAMOUR!

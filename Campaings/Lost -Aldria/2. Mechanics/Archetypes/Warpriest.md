# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
These clerics meet their foes with the might of powers beyond mortal ken. Blessed blades strike down spiritual assailants, divine will shelters allies from enemy onslaught, and victory flies to them on holy wings. Warpriests come from many walks of life—some from the worship of martial gods, some from the ritual of training, and others by catching the eye of greater entities through their prowess and soldierly dedication. 

Whatever their origin, warpriests are imbued with the combined forces of a warrior’s strength and a cleric’s commitment to their cause.

**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

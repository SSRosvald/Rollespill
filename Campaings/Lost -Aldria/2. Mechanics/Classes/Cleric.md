## Overview
Clerics are the conduits through which many deities and greater entities of the planes manifest their will, and as such have great variety among their number.  
  
Some clerics worship one or many gods (possibly even entities of darkness) while others attend to a philosophy or ideology which resonate with matters of ultimacy. Witting or unwitting, joyful or begrudging, lighthearted or solemn—clerics are the sheer presence of divine favor.
![[Pasted image 20240305214700.png|right]]
## Divine Mission

With divine power at their fingertips clerics can heal the wounded and even revive the dead. Their allies glow with boons wrought from outside the Material Plane, and their enemies fall into shadow and flame as they feel the wrath of almighty forces. These abilities are granted when the cleric is chosen by a greater entity, or even a whole pantheon, to fulfill a divine duty, and more are given as they prove themselves worthy. With expertise in both protection and affliction, clerics are indomitable allies and terrifying foes. When the time calls for it some are just as handy in close quarters with a mace or warhammer as they are at the sidelines with an amulet and divine word. Unlike many spellcasters, a cleric distills their magical ability from acts of devotion and revelations from beyond the pale. Their command over supernatural power stems from their unique connection to forces outside of this realm, and from the mission granted to them.
## Revelation

No matter their religion or cause, a cleric is distinct from the average worshiper and even those at the highest echelons of its hierarchy. Rather than simply choosing a spiritual path, they are called to a spiritual duty. Their greater entity has chosen them as a vessel for their will, anointing the cleric with theurgic magic to manifest commands from beyond.

A cleric may receive their divine mission in the fog of a dream, the gentle whispers of nature, or the appearance of an intercessory messenger (such as angelic or demonic beings, a holy animal, or a long-deceased ancestor) after long study of holy texts. The cleric may even have been non-religious until the moment of their calling (and might still consider themselves that way), born with an innate skill or understanding essential to their mission—for them worship is often more in the form of deeds than in prayer or meditation. Their precise goal is shaped by the entity or pantheon they worship and their chosen archetype (and perhaps a discussion with the Narrator). An oracle may be bound to travel the world and distribute word of things to come, whereas a healer may wade into the chaos of battle to rescue the wounded. Whatever their mission, adventure is central to the life of clerics as they perform the extraordinary to fulfill their duty.
## Creating a Cleric

The most important detail for your cleric is their religious identity. Are you a member of a religious or philosophical tradition, or are you non-religious? How did becoming a cleric change your life? As a cleric you are a chosen of a greater entity or pantheon and a religious or ideological leader in some form. Do you have a relationship with the other elders of your faith? Were you appointed to this role, or do you come to your authority by other means?

Having faith is important, but clerics are also the hands and mouthpiece of the power they serve. Many clerics are representatives of kindly and nurturing forces, while others serve wrathful entities whose message strikes the heart with terror. What services or actions make your spiritual leadership? What is the divine message you have to share?

# 1st Level
## Cleric Archetype

Your holy vocation comes to the fore through your choice of a Cleric Archetype. Choose one of the following archetypes: [[Healer]], [[Lightbringer]], [[Oracle]], or [[Warpriest]]. This choice represents how you wish to communicate your values and ideals to the world at large. Although some archetypes lend themselves to a given religion or ideology, each archetype is suitable for most any belief system—even if such a presentation is provocative. Your choice of archetype will likely help inform your character’s goals, desires, and even personality. 

At 1st level you gain archetype spells and other features. Your archetype grants you additional features at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level.

### Archetype Spells

With your archetype you gain access to a list of archetype spells at the levels noted in your archetype description. Once you gain an archetype spell it is always prepared and doesn’t count against the spells you can prepare each day. 

If you gain an archetype spell that is not on the cleric spell list, it is considered a cleric spell for you.

## Defensive Blessing

Starting at 1st level, the high powers which guide you bestow a modicum of protection for your journey. Choose one of the following options.

### Armor of Conviction

While you are not wearing any armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

Also, in addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have _[shield of faith](https://a5e.tools/spell/shield-faith "Click to view a local node.")_ prepared.

### Sacred Archery 

You gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and ranged martial weapons.

### Spirit Soldier

You gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and shields.

## Sacred Call

Also at 1st level, your clerical vocation anoints you with certain graces for spreading your message to the people. Choose one of the following.

### Clerical Charisma

Crowds find your public presence irresistible. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill. Whenever you use Performance to deliver a sermon or to sing holy songs in a town or city, even on a failed check other than a natural 1, you still attract a crowd of people no smaller than your spell save DC.

### Ordination

Your mission in the world is supported by the spiritual community or religious hierarchy who called you to religious service. As a formal leader within your religious order, you are expected to perform the ceremonies of your faith, including weddings and funerals. In exchange, members of your faith provide you and your companions with food, lodging, and a modest lifestyle.

Additionally, if your congregation or order is able, they send you letters with regular updates about their well-being. They are willing to help connect you with other chapters of your faith through letters of introduction.

### Zeal of the Convert

You enthusiastically see the hand of a greater entity everywhere. You gain [advantage](https://a5e.tools/node/130 "Click to view a local node.") on Persuasion checks when you invoke the name of your deity or movement during a conversation with a pious person. If the listener is negatively disposed to your greater entity or movement, you have [disadvantage](https://a5e.tools/node/137 "Click to view a local node.") instead.

## Spellcasting

Sanctioned by the highest powers, you can cast spells to enact sacred miracles. See [Spells Rules](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.

| Level | Cantrips Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| :---: | :------------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  1st  |       3        |  2  |  -  |  -  |  -  |

|  8th  |       4        |  4  |  3  |  3  |  2  |
### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

In addition to these, you also know the _[thaumaturgy](https://a5e.tools/spell/thaumaturgy "Click to view a local node.")_ cantrip.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells. To cast one of these cleric spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") .

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Casting spells doesn’t remove them from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long rest by meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your [spellcasting](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier

Spell damage bonus = your wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. You can also cast the ceremony spell as a ritual whether you have the spell prepared or not.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

# 2Nd Level 
## Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you are able to channel the energy of your greater entity directly, and use it for a variety of magical effects. You start with two of these effects: Turn Undead and an additional effect dependent on your chosen Cleric Archetype. Some archetypes provide additional uses of Channel Divinity as your cleric level increases, detailed under the heading of your chosen archetypes. 

You may choose which Channel Divinity effect to create each time you use this feature. You must then finish a [short or long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") before you’re able to Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") . The DC for this is the same as your cleric spell save DC.

From 6th level you can use your Channel Divinity twice between [rests](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") , and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. Finishing a short or long rest regains your expended uses.

### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present the holy symbol of your greater entity and speak a divine word, rebuking the undead. Each [undead](https://a5e.tools/node/1365 "Click to view a local node.") creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") . If the creature fails it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage from any source. 

A turned creature must use its turns trying to move as far away from you as possible. It cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cannot take reactions. On its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape any effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 

## Principles of Devotion

At 2nd level, after much contemplation and communion with your greater entity, you pledge to uphold certain standards of behavior beyond what is necessary for adventure. In return, your greater entity grants you one of the following related boons. When you fail to uphold this pledge, you lose any benefits from it until 24 hours after you finish a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") and rededicate yourself.

### Chaste

In exchange for forgoing pleasures of the heart and flesh, you are hardened to the persuasions of others. Add your Wisdom modifier to any [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") made to resist being [charmed](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") . You also gain one skill specialty chosen from Insight, Persuasion, or Religion.

### Destitute

In exchange for forgoing material luxury, vendors who are not explicitly opposed to your greater entity are compelled to give you heavy discounts of up to 20%, and inkeeps offer free lodging.

### Devotional Integrity

You adhere to a strict code of morality and ethics. When an action you take is honest and non-violent, until the end of your turn you are immune to the [rattled](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") condition and you do not suffer [disadvantage](https://a5e.tools/node/137 "Click to view a local node.") or penalties on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks made as part of that action.

### Image of the Divine

You exhibit a uniform, makeup, tattoo, or body modification indicating your higher entity or religious order. Creatures have [advantage](https://a5e.tools/node/130 "Click to view a local node.") when discerning your religious identity. You gain advantage on [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") against [fear](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") and [ability checks](https://a5e.tools/node/147 "Click to view a local node.") made against Intimidation. You also gain one skill specialty chosen from Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.

### Merciful

In exchange for forgoing bloodshed—torture, attacking [unconscious](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") creatures, and dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce to 0 hit points—you are yourself granted mercy. When you have already succeeded on two death [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") , you have [advantage](https://a5e.tools/node/130 "Click to view a local node.") on death saving throws.

### Rule of Ritual

You make formal religious observances and perform ritual timekeeping. You can spend 1 hour during a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") to make these observances, and if you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the normal 6. You learn the _[guidance](https://a5e.tools/spell/guidance "Click to view a local node.")_ cantrip if you do not already know it, and when you grant [expertise dice](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") with a spell of 1st-level or higher, the expertise die you grant increases by one step.

### Secrecy

Your mission from your deity requires you to work undercover, concealing your true self with a secret identity. In exchange for forgoing the pleasure of true connection and friendship, you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Deception checks.

### Severity

In exchange for forgoing weaknesses such as helping or protecting others (except when it serves you), you add your Wisdom modifier to Perception checks made to find valuable objects, and on opposed checks made against the Persuasion check of another creature.

### Silence

In exchange for speaking only to cast spells, you are able to compel other creatures to action with only a glance. When a creature within 10 feet of you makes a Persuasion check, you may add your Wisdom modifier to the result.

## Archetype Feature

At 2nd level you gain another archetype feature.
# 3rd Level 
## Signs of Faith

At 3rd level, you gain a sign of faith of your choice. Signs of faith are detailed at the end of your class description. The Signs Known column of the Cleric table shows when you gain new signs.
# 4th Level 
## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
## Sacred Office

Also at 4th level, your mission has taken root and is known through much of the land, conveying rumors both good and ill about your deeds. Choose one of the following. 

### Auspicious Collaborator

The higher powers you are attuned to have witnessed your deeds and bestowed upon you a quality of worthiness. Your requests for aid are perceived as opportunities for partnership rather than impositions.

People of all backgrounds are more drawn to help you than they would ordinarily be. You gain one specialty chosen from Culture or Persuasion, and you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Persuasion checks related to seeking aid.

### Divine Authority

Your connection to religious hierarchy opens many doors. Sermons you give and courtesy calls you make to different religious groups put you in contact with a local representative of your faith, who is happy to strongly recommend you to another local leader. You gain one specialty chosen from Culture, Insight, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Culture, Insight, and Persuasion checks made against local leaders to whom you are recommended that would otherwise be indifferent towards you.

### Engaging Proclaimer

Your recitations of divine stories, songs, or chants quickly build and hold an audience’s attention, whether you are speaking to a packed tavern or a smaller gathering. You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Performance checks to gather and hold the attention of 2 or more people. In addition, you gain two skill specialties, chosen from Performance and Religion.

### Reputation

Your reputation for talented ministry and good works precedes you. Common folk frequently recognize you on sight, and those who do often have a friendly disposition towards you. They often ask you for counsel, favors, and blessings. The disposition of people they introduce you to are one stage better than normal (the indifferent become friendly, the hostile become indifferent).

### Symbol of Might

The strength of the powers you serve is obvious to anybody you interact with, and you are able to use it to garner a certain level of fear and compliance. You gain one Intimidation specialty, and you gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Intimidation checks made to convince others to comply with your demands. The people you intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if they were previously.
# 5th Level 
## Empowered Turning

At 5th level your greater entity grants you improved ways to turn undead or other abhorrent beings. You gain this feature again at 8th, 11th, 14th, and 17th level. Each time you gain Empowered Turning, choose one of the following:

### Command Undead

If you choose, creatures you turn instead regard you as their master for the duration. While they are under this effect, you may use your action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height, jump onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow the command until you issue a new one.

### Destroy Undead

Creatures turned by you of CR ½ or less are immediately destroyed, transformed into dust by a blinding flash of light. You can select this option multiple times. Each time you choose it, you are able to destroy more powerful creatures, progressing to CR 1, CR 2, CR 3, and then CR 4 each subsequent time you select this option. 

### Turn Ideology

Choose one of the following: Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful. When you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures with the chosen alignment trait. You can select this option multiple times.

### Turn Supernatural

Choose a creature type from celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend. When you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures of that type. You can select this option multiple times.
# 6th Level 
## Archetype Feature

At 6th level you gain another archetype feature.
# 8th Level 
## Archetype Feature

At 8th level you gain another archetype feature.

# Signs of Faith

When you gain access to a new sign of faith, choose one of the following.

### Ancestral Guidance

In addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have speak with dead prepared, and you can use this feature to cast it once between [long rests](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") without spending a spell slot. When you do so, you do not have to target a corpse; you can also target a grave marker, memorial, statue, painting, or other depiction of the deceased creature you wish to talk to. If the chosen creature is not dead, or if such a creature never existed in the first place, the spell fails.

### Compassionate Nurse

Your insight and sympathy more than make up for your lack of formal medical training. You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Medicine checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Medicine checks.

### Faithful Historian

You have a deep relationship with religious history and art. You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on History checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making History checks.

### Gentle Healer

During a [short rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") , you can spend uses from your healer’s satchel to aid your allies in their recovery. A creature you choose may roll expended Hit Dice twice, taking the higher result. You may not expend your own Hit Dice while using this feature, since you use all of your energies to heal your companions.

### Graceful Fall

Falling from a height greater than 30 feet causes your greater entity to intervene. You are protected as if by the _[feather fall](https://a5e.tools/spell/feather-fall "Click to view a local node.")_ spell. This sign does not use your reaction. 

### Monastic Austerity

Your greater entity acts as a buffer to shield you from hardship or your religious self-discipline sustains you even during harsh times. Preventing the first level of [fatigue](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") you would take each day.

### Numinous Awareness

When you see a creature that appears to be a beast, you automatically recognize whether it is a celestial, fiend, or fey. You have [advantage](https://a5e.tools/node/130 "Click to view a local node.") on Arcana and Medicine checks made to interact with magical wounds and maladies caused by celestials, fiends, and fey.

### Premonition

You have the ability to interpret messages sent to you in dreams or visions by your greater entity. After each [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") you know either:

- a piece of information that will help you in your endeavours before the end of your next long rest,

- or, how one action will play out before the end of your next long rest. Roll a d20. Before the end of your next long rest, you may choose to replace any roll made by a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you with the result of this d20 roll.

The Narrator lets you know which benefit is available whenever you finish a long rest.

### Preservation

Your connection to a greater entity allows you to sense poison or [disease](https://a5e.tools/rules/diseases "Click to view a local node.") in food, drink, or other consumables. You must have had direct contact with them or their container in order to sense this corruption.

### Righteous Path

Divine intuition guides you through the tangled paths of constructed or inhabited areas without confusion. Once per day you may choose to walk the Righteous Path for 1 hour. While walking the Righteous Path, you are aware when enemies are within 60 feet of you, and you know if backtracking or alternate routes could avoid them. You can also use an action to sense if there are traps within 30 feet, but not the location or nature of the traps.

### Soothing Words

Your divinely-inspired counsel and wise advice can calm troubled minds. You may reduce one ally’s [strife](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") by one level. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") . 

### Supernal Intuition

Choose a creature type from fiend, fey, celestial, elemental, or undead. You know when a creature of this type is within 60 feet of you, although you do not know its location. Nondetection protects against this feature. You may select this sign multiple times, choosing a different creature type each time.

### Theologian

Years of devoted learning have given you a deep understanding regarding the evolution of religion, theology, and the figures involved. You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Religion checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Religion checks.

### Voice of Doom

Your personal knowledge of divine wrath and the end times make your proclamations utterly chilling. You gain an [expertise die](https://a5e.tools/node/77 "Click to view a local node.") on Intimidation checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Intimidation checks.

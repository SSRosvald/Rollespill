traits:
  - name: Undead Fortitude
    desc: If damage reduces the Sibsig Host to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or in form of a critical hit. On a success, the Sibsig Host drops to 1 hit point instead.
  - name: Exposed Brain
    desc: The Sibsig Host's dead brain contains the psychic energy that keeps it 'alive'. As a bonus action on its turn, it can roll a d4. On a 1, nothing happens, and the Sibsig Host takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. Otherwise, it emits a pulse of psychic energy in a 15 foot radius sphere centered on itself. Each non-undead creature inside must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed one. If the save fails for 5 or more, a creature also loses concentration on anything it was concentrating into.
  - name: Host
    desc: The host is composed of 8 or more creatures. If it is subjected to a spell, attack, or other effect that affects only one target, it takes any damage but ignores other effects. It can share its space with Medium or smaller creatures or objects. The squad can move through any opening large enough for one Medium creature without squeezing.
actions:
  - name: Multiattack.
    desc: The Sibsig Host can make two Slam attacks.
  - name: Slam.
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d12 + 2) bludgeoning damage."

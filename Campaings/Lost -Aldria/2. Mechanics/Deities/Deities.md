# Pantheon
Gudene ble under kampen mot Tiamat revet vekk fra Aldria, men ny tro begynte å oppstå etter hvert. Hvorvidt dette er nye guder, eller om det er gamle guder som har glemt sitt eget navn, eller om folket har glemt det, er uvisst. Helgner har også oppstått, men hvem vet om disse helgnene har tatt på seg en guderolle eller ikke.

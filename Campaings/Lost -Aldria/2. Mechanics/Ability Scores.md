Every creature has six ability scores to describe their physical attributes and mental characteristics: Strength for physical power and prowess, Dexterity for agility and reflexes, Constitution for health and hardiness,  Intelligence for memory and wits, Wisdom for awareness and intuition, and Charisma for force of personality.

In addition to these six, they form a combination of six sub-abilities that are equally important for characters: Fortitude to determine hit-points and physical resistances, Athleticism to determine Combat Maneuver and overall physical capabilities, Initiative do determine how quickly you are able to make decisions both in and out of combat, Knowledge to determine how much your character actually know, Willpower to determine your overall psychical resistances, and Glamour to determine your overall beauty and ability to affect those around you without the use of magic.

Ability scores define some of a creature’s qualities, assets, and weaknesses. The numbers in each of a creature’s ability scores measure a mixture of innate capability, training, and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the human average, and a truly exceptional person might have an 18 in an ability score. Adventurers often start their journeys with above average scores in some of their abilities, and through hardship and experience can reach scores as high as 20. Likewise, many monsters have above average ability scores, and the most powerful—such as ancient dragons and divine beings—can have scores as high as 30.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier, derived from its score, ranging from –5 (for a score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The table below lists the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30, but note only through extraordinary circumstances can a player character have an ability score below 8 or above 20.

The three main rolls of the game—ability checks, [saving throws](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") , and [attack rolls](https://a5e.tools/rules/making-attack "Click to view a local node.") —rely on the ability modifiers derived from the six ability scores. Because ability modifiers affect almost every roll, they come up during play more often than their associated scores.

Ability Scores and Modifiers

|Score|Modifier|
|---|---|
|1|-5|
|2-3|-4|
|4-5|-3|
|6-7|-2|
|8-9|-1|
|10-11|+0|
|12-13|+1|
|14-15|+2|

# Using Each Ability 

### Strength
Strength measures the power of the physical body and the extent to which you can use your body to exert physical force.

**Damage Rolls**
Strength is used do determine how much extra damage you do with your physical attacks. Unless stated otherwise, melee attacks uses your Strength modifier when adding bonus damage.

**Lifting and Carrying**
Your Strength score determines how much weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
	***Carrying Capacity.*** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) you can carry as you go about day-to-day business. If you exceed your carrying capacity, you are encumbered (see Appendix: Conditions).
	***Bulky Items.*** You can carry a number of bulky items equal to 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If you exceed this number, you are encumbered.
	***Supplies.*** You can carry a number of Supplies equal to your Strength score in addition to the rest of your gear. 
	***Push, Drag, or Lift.*** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity you are encumbered.
	***Size and Strength.**** Tiny creatures can’t carry much, while Larger creatures can carry more. A Tiny creature’s carrying capacity is halved and it can’t carry bulky objects. For each size category above Medium, Larger creatures double their carrying capacity, the number of bulky items they can carry, and the amount they can push, drag, or lift. A creature can only be considered a maximum of one size larger or smaller when determining how much Supply and weight it can carry.

### Athleticism 
Athleticism measures your overall physical capabilities when performing physical feats. This is determined by adding your Strength and Dexterity modifier.

**Attack Rolls**
Athleticism is one of the default abilities when making attacks. When you make an attack roll using a weapon, you add your Athleticism modifier to the attack roll.

**Athleticism Checks**
Athleticism is used for any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force yourself through tight spaces, to jump, climb, or swim beyond your usual physical limits, and to otherwise apply brute force to a situation:
* Forcing a stuck or locked door.
* Bursting out of bonds.
* Tearing a thick book in half.
* Squeezing into a tunnel that is too small.
* Hanging onto a moving wagon while being dragged along.
* Tipping over a statue.
* Holding up a collapsing mine shaft.
* Stopping a rolling boulder.

Athleticism is also used for any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, to keep from falling on tricky footing, or to perform physical tasks focused on deft-fingered movements rather than force:
* Sneaking behind a distracted [[Guard]].
* Staying on your feet on slick ice.
* Concealing a playing card up your sleeve.
* Steering a chariot around a tight turn.
* Tinkering with a mechanical device.
* Securely tying a prisoner.
* Wriggling free of bonds.
* Crafting a Tiny detailed object.

**Combat Maneuver**
A maneuver sometimes forces a target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
	**Maneuver DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Athleticism modifier
	Combat maneuvers are nonmagical

### Dexterity 
Dexterity mesures your physical grace, balance, agility, and reflexes.

**Damage Rolls**
Dexterity is used to determine how much extra damage you you deal using some melee attacks, and most ranged attack weapons. When you make an attack using a ranged weapon like a crossbow, longbow, or sling, you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage roll. When using a melee weapon with the finesse property (such as a rpier or whip), you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier. 

**Armor class**
The armor you wear determines whether you add any, some, or all of your Dexterity modifier to your [[Equipment|Armor Class]].

### Initiative 
Initiative measures your quick wit and ability to act quickly. Initiative is also used to roll for turn order in combat, and can be used by the narrator outside of combat to determine who may act first in a [[Social Encounter]]. This is determined by adding your Dexterity and Intelligence.

### Intelligence 
Intelligence measures mental swiftness and acuity, accuracy of recall, past education and learning, and the ability to reason.

**Spellcasting Ability**
Intelligence determines the number of spells a [[Wizard]] can prepare each day, and their spell damage bonus.

### Knowledge 
Knowledge is a measure of your overall total knowledge, both learned by experience, and gained otherwise. This is determined by adding your Intelligence and Wisdom modifier.

**Bonus Knowledge**
Having a higher Knowledge means having more information than other characters. During character creation, for each point of your Knowledge modifier above 0 you can choose a [skill speciality] chosen from lore skills ([Arcana], [Culture], [Engineering], [History], [Nature], [Religion]). If you are not proficient in any lore skills you either gain proficiency with a lore skill, choose an extra language known, or pick a toolm proficiency in one artisan's tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle.
When your Intelligence or Wisdom changes, it affects your bonus knowledge. When it increases, you can choose an additional skill speciality in the skills listed above as if you always had the new modifier. 

**Knowledge Checks**
Knowledge is frequently used to recall details of the shared adventure world, representing memory and education—knowledge obvious to a character even if unknown or forgotten by their player. It is also used when you need to draw on logic or deductive reasoning:
- Recalling lore.
- Estimating the value of a precious item.
- Describing an object from memory.
- Forging a document.
- Winning a game of wits.
- Deducing the link between clues and a killer.
- Outsmarting a charlatan.
- Using a little information to appear to be an expert.

Knowledge is frequently used to notice details of the shared adventure world immediately around you, representing what you perceive in the moment—the present world obvious to your character as described by the Narrator. It is also used to understand feelings and emotions, read body language, offer appropriate care to others, and discern cryptic omens on an intuitive rather than logical level:
- Calming a frightened animal.
- Noticing a lie from the liar’s mannerisms.
- Predicting an opponent’s next move.
- Providing care for a sick companion.
- Detecting an unusual odor or sound in the air.
- Spotting an enemy waiting in ambush.
- Tracking wild game through thick undergrowth.
- Interpreting a gut-feeling about an upcoming course of action.

**Spellcasting Ability**
[[Wizard|Wizards]] and some [[Warlock|Warlocks]] use Knowledge as their spellcasting ability to determine their spell attack bonus and saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. 

### Wisdom 
Wisdom measures your attunement to the world around you: your intuition, mental endurance, and perceptiveness.

**Spellcasting Ability**
Wisdom determines the number of spells a [[Cleric]] or [[Druid]] can prepare each day, and their spell damage bonus.

### Willpower 
Willpower is a measure of your mental fortitude and endurance. This will be used to determine if your will is able to be manipulated by others. This is determined by adding your Wisdom and Charisma modifier.

**Spellcasting Ability**
[[Cleric|Clerics]], [[Druid|druids]], and some [[Warlock|warlocks]] use Willpower as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast.

### Charisma 
Charisma measures your ability to effectively interact with others, including your confidence and eloquence, as well as the power of your personality (be it charming, commanding, or forceful).

**Spellcasting Ability**
Charisma determines the number of spells a [[Herald|herald]] can prepare each day, and the spell damage bonus for [[Bard|bards]] and [[Herald|heralds]].

### Glamour 
Glamour measures your ability to keep others eyes upon yourself. Glamour is used whenever you want to be seen and heard, somewhat the opposite of stealth. This is determined by adding your Charisma and Constitution modifier.

**Glamour Checks**
Glamour is used in social situations to determine first impressions, to fit in or stand out, and to influence others:
- Deceiving a monster of your true intentions.
- Threatening a guard to allow you to pass.
- Engaging in a dramatic performance to inspire a crowd.
- Convincing a frightened child you mean them no harm.
- Haggling with a shopkeeper for a better price.
- Blending into a crowd to overhear rumors.

**Spellcasting Ability**
[[Bard|Bards]], [[Herald|heralds]], [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and some [[Warlock|warlocks]] use Glamour as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and saving throw DCs of the spells they cast.

### Constitution 
Constitution measures your physical health, stamina, and vitality.

**Spellcasting Ability**
Constitution determine how many additional spells you are able to concentrate on at any given time. Constitution also determines a [[Sorcerer|sorcerer's]] spell damage bonus.

### Fortitude 
Fortitude describes how hardy you are, and how resistant you are to natural poisons. This is determined by adding your Constitution and Strength modifier. 

**Hit Points**
A terrible blow from a giant's axe may only leave a bruise beneath an adventurer's armor, but it takes a greater toll on their ability to continue fighting. Hit Points are more than flesh and blood — they are also sweat, migraines, wherewithal, composure, and more besides. Players and narrators alike should view Hit Points as an abstraction and not the number of pints of blood in a creatures body.
Your Fortitude modifier contributes to your hit points. Whenever you roll Hit Dice to determine the increase to your hit point maximum when gaining a level or to recover hit points during a short rest, you add your Fortitude modifier to each dice roll.
If your Constitution or Strength modifier changes, this will also change Fortitude, which again affect your hit point maximum.

**Fortitude Checks**
Fortitude checks are uncommon because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort. Fortitude is used for any attempt to physically push beyond normal limits over a period of time:
- Remaining perfectly still for over an hour.
- Holding your breath.
- Marching without rest for many hours.
- Staying awake for several days.
- Enduring thirst and starvation.
- Winning a pie eating competition.

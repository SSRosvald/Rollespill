## Effects

Increase your Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. 

You can speak with animals (as the spell) of the same type as your curse (bears for a wereboar, boars for a wereboar, and so on). You can also cast animal friendship without spending material components, but are only able to target animals of the same type as your curse. Once you have used this feature to cast animal friendship, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against animals when the moon is full.

**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Overview
You have created a flair that you use when casting spells. Choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long rest, you may replace your flair with another. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair. You can do so again when you finish a short or long rest

### Awe and Wonder 
Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a movement speed of 0, and does nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. If it takes any damage or is forced to make another saving throw, the charm effect ends.

### Terror 
Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, it starts its turn by using its full movement to get away from you in the most direct manner possible, avoiding obvious hazards along the way. 

### Brilliance 
Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. 

### Warding 
After casting the spell, until the start of your next turn, a creature who attempts to attack you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must choose a new target or waste its attack.

**Prerequisite**: `=this.prerequisite`

## Overview
Drawing upon the magic effects of life, you are now able to use your own blood and stamina to perform magical feats. 
Spellcasters who practice the art of Blood Magic do not use spells per day, but rather their own pool of hit points to cast spells. As long as they are above 0 hit points, they are able to cast spells.

## Effects
Upon taking this feat, the caster is bestowed the following:

- The caster gains the Blood Pact ability.
- Effects that would cause the caster to regain hit-points are halved, rounded down (with the following exception: Health gained after a night's rest).
- Casters who form the blood pact are incapable of using [[Conjuration]] ([[Healing]]) spells that directly restore hit points (such as [[cure wounds]]) to blood magic users (including themselves). Any attempt to do so have no effect on the recipient, and instead, the cost of casting the spell is reverted to the caster.
- You will gain a new "resource" the Blood Clot Dice. When casting a spell, you may roll a d4. This is the only damage reduction you gain when casting the spell. You gain Blood Clot Dice equal to your proficiency modifier each long rest. 

### Preparing spells 
When under a Blood Pact, spellcasters still prepare spells as usual. The limit of only being able to cast a certain number of spells per day is removed. You must still adhere to the limits of number of spells you are able to prepare per day.

**Spontaneous Spellcasting**
Characters who cast their spells spontaneously - such as bards and sorcerers - don't have to prepare spells. They can cast any spell they know by spending the requisite number op hit points. 

### casting Spells

When casting spells, you must do so by paying an amount of hit points as described in the table below. 
The damage taken from casting spells through blood magic cannot be mitigated by any means other than with the Blood Clot Dice.
A spellcaster who uses Blood Magic is no stranger to pain. The damage they self inflict while casting spells does not count against them, and they do not need to make Constitution saving throws to continue casting spells. Furthermore, they may ignore a number of points of damage taken from external sources (to a maximum of their caster level) every turn before having to make checks to maintain concentration.

| Spell Level | Hit Points |
| :---------: | :--------: |
|     1st     |     2      |
|     2nd     |     3      |
|     3rd     |     5      |
|     4th     |     6      |
|     5th     |     7      |
As a last resort, the character with a blood pact may use more "blood" than their current hit points allow, up to a maximum of their caster level below 0 hit points. This will automatically give the caster one level of [fatigue], and they are now unconscious, but stable.

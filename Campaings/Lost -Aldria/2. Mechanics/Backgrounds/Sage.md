## Overview
You are a seeker of the world’s truths and an expert in your chosen field, with esoteric knowledge at your fingertips, or at the farthest, in a book you vaguely remember.

Why have you left the confines of the library to explore the wider world? Do you seek ancient wisdom? Power? The answer to a specific question? Reinstatement in your former institution?

**Ability Score Increases:** +1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, and either Arcana, Culture, Engineering, or Religion.

**Languages:** Two of your choice.

**Suggested Equipment (Cost 16 gold):** Bottle of ink, pen, 50 sheets of parchment, common clothes.

**_Feature: Library Privileges_****. As a fellow or friend of several universities you have visiting access to the great libraries, most of which are off-limits to the general public. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20 Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).

**_Adventures and Advancement_****. When you visit libraries and universities you tend to be asked for help in your role as a comparatively rough-and-tumble adventurer. After fetching a few bits of esoteric knowledge and settling a few academic disputes, you may be granted access to the restricted areas of the library (which contain darker secrets and deeper mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25 Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).

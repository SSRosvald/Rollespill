## Effects
Until the spell ends, you are shrouded in distortion and your image is blurred. Creatures make [attack rolls](https://a5e.tools/rules/making-attack "Click to view a local node.") against you with [disadvantage](https://a5e.tools/node/137 "Click to view a local node.") unless they have senses that allow them to perceive without sight or to see through illusions (like blindsight or truesight).

**Cast at Higher Levels**

You may target an additional willing creature you can see within range for each slot level above 2nd. Whenever an affected creature other than you is hit by an attack, the spell ends for that creature. When using a higher level spell slot, increase the spellâ€™s range to 30 feet.

## Effects
You create a floating, incandescent weapon with an appearance of your choosing and use it to attack your enemies. On the round you cast it, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon that deals force damage equal to 1d8 + your [spellcasting ability modifier](https://a5e.tools/rules/spellcasting "Click to view a local node.") .

As a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make another attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Cast at Higher Levels**

The damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

### Rare Versions

_**Komanovâ€™s Fell Spiritual Weapon.**_ The weapon deals necrotic damage instead of force damage, and when it scores a critical hit its target is [[Conditions#Rattled|rattled]] until the end of your next turn.

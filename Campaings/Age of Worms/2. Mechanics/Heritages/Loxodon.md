# Loxodon

Loxodonene vandret sydover fra is-ødet helt nord på kontinentet da magien i verden endret seg, og kulden spredde seg videre. Utrolig sjeldne i seg selv, men de fa en ser befinner seg nå på Qal-sisma slettene, noen i familiegrupper med andre skapninger.

## Loxodon traits

**Age.** Loxodons physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they live about 450 years. They highly value the weight of wisdom and experience and are considered young until they reach the age of 60.

**Size.** Loxodons stand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet

**_Heavy Lifter._**  When determining your carrying capacity and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered to be Large. 

***Natural Armor.*** You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

***Trunk.*** You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.

Your trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.

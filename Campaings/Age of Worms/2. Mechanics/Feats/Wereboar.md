# New Moon Wereboar
## Overview

You have learned to tame the boar rampaging within you since contracting lycanthropy. On full moon nights you involuntarily change into a boar or boar-humanoid hybrid.

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisites***: *[[Lycanthropy|Must have been bitten by a wereboar]]*

## Effects

While you are transformed, you gain the following features. 

***Fleet of Foot.*** Your Speed increases by 10 feet. 

***Relentless.*** Once between long rests when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. 

***Tusks.*** You gain tusk natural weapons you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your tusks. On a hit, your tusks deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest).

# Swineheart
## Overview

Your control over the porcine spirit within yourself improves. You can transform one additional time without suffering a level of fatigue. 

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisites:*** *New Moon Wereboar*

## Effects

***Boar Charge.*** Once per turn when you move at least 20 feet straight towards a target before attacking with your tusks, the attack deals an extra 2d6 slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC, falling prone on a failure. 

***Crescent Moon Defense.*** You gain resistance against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from weapons that are not magical or silvered. 

***Frenzied Tusks.*** You can use your tusks attack as a bonus action

# Alpha Wereboar
## Overview

You have completely mastered the boar within. You can transform one additional time without suffering a level of fatigue. When you choose to tame the beast in an involuntary transformation, roll 1d8; you gain control over that many hours.

## Requirements and Restrictions

***Prerequisites:*** *Swineheart*

## Effects

While you are transformed, you gain the following features.

***Deadly Tusks.*** The damage of your tusks increases to 1d8. 

***Full Moon Defense.*** You gain immunity against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from weapons that are not magical or silvered. 

***Full Moon Ferocity.*** If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a tusks attack, you regain your use of the Relentless feature. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest
